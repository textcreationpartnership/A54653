            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation to all men, hath appeared: Teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world: looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; that we may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2 10-13. <hi>How this Doctrine according to Godlineſs is blaſphemed and evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken of by many perſons, we cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; As if it were a Doctrine of Looſneſs, and Licentiouſneſs; a Doctrine of Libertiniſm, and Profaneſs; as if it opened a Gap to all
<pb facs="tcp:48912:3"/>
wickedneſs and impiety whatſoever: And though men herein be-ly it, yet certainly we ſhall give occaſion to them that are of no judgment concerning the Faith, thus to ſpeak reproachfully of it, if while we ſeek to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſt, we our ſelves are found ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and walk not uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel,</hi> Gal. 2. 14-18. <hi>And,</hi> Wo to the world becauſe of offences: But wo eſpecially to that man by whom the offence cometh: <hi>Wherefore ſaith our Saviour,</hi> If thy hand, or thy foot offend thee, <hi>or, cauſe thee to offend,</hi> cut them off, and caſt them from thee: it is better for thee to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life halt, or maimed, rather than having two hands, or two feet, to be caſt into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 7, 8. <hi>You know in your hearts, and in your ſouls, that he that died for all, therefore died for them,</hi> that they which live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves <hi>or the luſes of men,</hi> but unto the will of God: even to him that died for them, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>with</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 1-3, <hi>You know, that the good creatures men abuſe in their intemperance, are the Lord's; And that by Grace we are made partakers of them; and have a comfortable enjoyment of them through the Sufferings, Sacrifice, and Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt: And that theſe things are not given us to conſume upon our Luſts, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for</hi> Baal: Shall ye then continue in
<pb facs="tcp:48912:3"/>
ſin becauſe grace hath abounded, <hi>or that it may abound?</hi> God forbid. He that knows his Maſters will, and doth it not, ſhall be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with many ſtripes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 47, 48. <hi>You know there is an eternal judgment, in which we ſhall all appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> That every one of us may receive according to the things done in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy—whether good or bad. For God ſhall bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. <hi>Oh therefore! knowing the terrour of the Lord, abſtain and flee from all intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance whatſoever. While</hi> Paul <hi>in declaring the faith in Chriſt,</hi> reaſoned of righteouſneſs, temperance, and judgment to come, Foelix trembled, <hi>perceiving it would go hardly with intemperate and incontinent ones hereafter,</hi> Act. 24. 24, 25. <hi>And can we hear and think thereof, and not tremble, ſo as to depart from iniquity? Surely then</hi> Felix <hi>hereafter ſhall riſe up in the judgment with us, and condemn us, when Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards ſhall be excluded and ſhut out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt and of God: Nay, by your own perſonal ſinning, you not only expoſe your ſelves to the Wrath of God, both preſent and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: But you cauſe many to ſtumble at the Law and Doctrine of Chriſt, and teach, and ſtrengthen the wicked ones in their evil wayes; and are guilty of the Blood of the Souls of others: And what will you do in the
<pb facs="tcp:48912:4"/>
end thereof?</hi> How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation! <hi>If you were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainers of ſuch ungodly Doctrines as are too generally received amongſt zealous ones now in our dayes; That the greateſt part of men were reprobated before they were born, and muſt neceſſarily periſh for ever hereafter; then your evil would not be ſo great concerning them: for you would but help to deſtroy them that God would not have ſaved. But for you to be inſtruments of evil and perdition to others, who profeſs to believe, that Chriſt died for all, and roſe again; and that God would have all men to be ſaved: How unſutably and contrary to your principles do you act, while you lay ſtumbling-blocks in their way, to cauſe them to fall and periſh, for whom you know Chriſt died? Oh! As your hearts are purified in obeying the truth through the Spirit, unto the unfeigned love of the Brethren, and of all men; ſee to it that ye love them with ſuch a love as you are taught and principled unto of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If any one ſhould ſay, we have ſuch a trade, employment, or way of lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to walk in, and follow, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are neceſſitated ſometimes to keep company, and to drink more than otherwiſe we would do, or elſe we had as good wholly leave off all; and then we ſhall preſently fail into poverty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To ſuch an one I would ſay,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:48912:4"/>
1. <hi>There is nothing ſaid, or however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in any expreſſion made uſe of, to take men off from any lawful, or laudable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or way of living: or from having fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the men of the world in and about the affairs of this life, in a lawful way:</hi> For then, <hi>as the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> ye muſt needs go out of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>But though we muſt have company with evil perſons, while we are here in this world at ſome times, and may trade with evil work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: yet</hi> by no means <hi>ſhould we</hi> have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>And if we cannot trade, or converſe with them, unleſs we put forth our hand to iniquity, it's better to loſe their custom, than to grieve the good Spirit of God, diſhonour the Goſpel, and get a ſnare and wound to our Souls: And be we confident, that in</hi> firſt ſeeking the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, all other things ſhall be added to us. <hi>Oh, Were we ſo filled with the Spirit, as to live the life we live in the fleſh by the faith of the Son of God, who loved us, and gave himſelf for us; we ſhould be helped to believe, and confidently expect, that he who ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, will alſo with him freely give us all things,</hi> Luk. 12. 29-31-33. Rom. 8. 32.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>But if the employment be ſuch as you know not how to follow it, and avoid the ſnares
<pb facs="tcp:48912:5"/>
that are in it, it is better to leave it, though it be never ſo profitable and advantageous, and though thereby you be reduced to the greateſt poverty imaginable, than to abide in it, if you cannot therein abide with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 24, By faith Moſes when he was come to years, refuſed to be called the Son of Pharoah's daughter: Chuſing rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin, <hi>which are but</hi> for a ſeaſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25. <hi>And if our hand or foot offend us (any work or way of ours) let us cut them off and caſt them from us:</hi> It is better for us to enter into life maimed or halt, than having two hands or feet, to be caſt into Hell, into the fire which ſhall never be quenched, where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched: <hi>As our Saviour ſaith,</hi> Mark 9. 43-46.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Another may ſay: Truly Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is a thing I delight not in: But when I meet with my friends or relations which are near to me, I ſometimes, though ſeldom, exceed in Wine, or Strong drink: And I do a little the more comply with them, that I might be an inſtrument of good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and by that means bring them to hear and receive the Goſpel. And therefore I hope God will be merciful to me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To ſuch an one I may ſay many things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is good indeed for us to walk in
<pb facs="tcp:48912:5"/>
love toward all men, and to be courteous to them,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3. 12. Luk. 6. 27-35. <hi>And eſpecially he that hath friends or relations that are beloved in the fleſh, ſhould ſhew himſelf friendly to ſuch, and be kind toward them,</hi> Prov. 18. 24. Philem. 16. <hi>But,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This is not Love indeed, nor Friendſhip toward them, when we have fellowſhip with them in any unfruitful work of darkneſs, ſuch as Intemperance; but hatred to them:</hi> For Love worketh no ill to his Neighbour, <hi>or, Brother,</hi> Rom. 13. 9, 10-13. <hi>When we keep Company with them in any thing that is evil, we do, as Job ſaith,</hi> Dig a pit for our friend, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 27. <hi>This may be indeed called, the love of the fleſh, thus to teſtify kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, proceeding from that</hi> Wiſdom which deſcendeth not from above, but which is earthly, ſenſual, and Devilliſh, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>But it is not Love in the Spirit: It is not loving-kindneſs, but hating-kindneſs towards them. And therefore while thou pretendeſt to teſtify Love to thy friend, thou doſt but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, for indeed in ſuch compliance thou hateſt him, and ſtrengtheneſt him in thoſe wayes which lead to the everlaſting deſtruction of his ſoul: And as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, ſo may I in this,</hi> If any man ſee thee which haſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>(ſome underſtanding of the Grace of God) ſit in Taverns, or Alehouſes, and drink to exceſs,</hi> ſhall not the conſcience of him that
<pb facs="tcp:48912:6"/>
is weak, be emboldned in his evil wayes? And through thy knowledg ſhall thy weak Brother periſh, for whom Chriſt died, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10, 11-13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſider; Though he be a Friend or Brother, to whom thou wouldeſt thus teſtify Love (which is in truth hatred), yet</hi> there is a Friend that ſticketh cloſer than a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>And one who hath infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exceeded all Friends in expreſſion of Love and affection to us; even our Lord Jeſus, who when we were become dead, died for us, and roſe again, and gave himſelf a ranſom for us; And while we were dead in ſins, cauſed his goodneſs to paſs before us; and is become our rightful Lord.

and treſpaſſes,</hi> in a ſad and miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2-5, 11, 12: and yet then Chriſt made peace for them, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to them, and they were ſaved by Grace out of that ſad condition, and made fellow-Citizens with the Saints; the Apoſtles Goſpel being received by them, not as the word of Men, but as it is in truth the Word of God; <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 13-22: minding them, how that now the Myſtery is opened and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, as it was not in former times: In which is contained, That the Gentiles ſhould have the unſearchable riches of Chriſt preached among them, and fellow-heirs in believing this Goſpel, which theſe Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers alſo were, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1-13.

In which we may take notice of the order of the Apoſtle in writing to the believers, namely, how he minds them of the Goſpel firſt of all, as it is now preached according to the Revelation of the Myſtery: And ſo gives to them Commandments by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. and 2, and 3, and 4. 1, 2. And amongſt others, he gives unto them this Commandment we have read, and propounded to ſpeak unto, and as that which was needful to be received, and obeyed, to the end they might avoid other evils; for ſurely this is the root of many other evils which here he admoniſheth of: and that exhortation here given is needful to our ſo walking more generally as to pleaſe God.</p>

In ſpeaking to which words, we ſhall firſt ſpeak thereto briefly by way of Explication: and then note ſome Inſtructions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of Explication, let us inquire and conſider,</p>

            <p n="1">1. Of what <hi>[Wine]</hi> he here ſpeaketh, and what is intended hereby.</p>
            <p>To this we may ſay, the <hi>Wine</hi> here ſpoken of in general, is ſuch as is oppoſed to the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the latter part of the verſe: and ſo it is not here to be underſtood as it may, and muſt be, in ſome places, to wit, for Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly-drink. So <hi>Wine</hi> is uſed at ſome times, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6, and 55. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this ſtill further appears, in what is added to this admonition, <hi>viz.</hi> he ſpeaks of ſuch <hi>Wine</hi> as in which is exceſs, which there cannot be in our receiving, and drinking in Chriſt, and the Spiritual things of and in him: But now here by <hi>Wine</hi> is meant that which is Earthly: And indeed it being oppoſed to the Spirit, and ſaid to be ſuch as in which is exceſs, it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more generally for all things on the Earth in which we are ſeeking delight, chearing, and comfort. But yet we ſhall look upon it in a more ſtrict conſideration, and ſo ſpeak of it, to wit, either as it ſignifies,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48912:11"/>
1. Moſt ſtrictly, <hi>The fruit of Earthly Vines</hi> Gen. 9. 20, 21. Mat. 26. 29. <hi>The blood of the Grape,</hi> Gen. 49, 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or alſo as more largely it ſignifies <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> of whatſoever, or howſoever it be made. As it ſeems there was <hi>Wine</hi> made of other Fruit beſide Grapes in former times (though alſo there are ſeveral ſorts of Grapes, and ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Wine</hi> made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 18,) as of Pomgranates, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 2, and ſo there might be of Apples and Pears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As ſtrong liquors are made with us of theſe Fruits, as Sider, Perry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Drink made hereof might be called <hi>Wine,</hi> or however included in this word, when it is mentioned alone; unleſs the context ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily confine it to <hi>Wine</hi> moſt properly ſo taken.

this Branch of their iniquity in <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1, <hi>They love Flagons of Wine:</hi> Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all their former abuſe of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies under their inordinate affection to <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Strong Drink.</hi> Thus alſo when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> writing unto, and directing <hi>Titus</hi> in the ordination of Elders and Biſhops, faith, <hi>If any be balmeleſs—not accuſed of riot;</hi> he adds, as the reaſon, <hi>For a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs—not given to Wine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 6, 7: where ſurely he gives us to underſtand, that the being given to <hi>Wine</hi> in verſe 7, is as large as being guilty of Riot, as that ſignifies intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, in <hi>v.</hi> 6: whereas Riot ſignifies intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in Meat as well as in Drink, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3, 4. And ſo being Drunken ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies being intemperate, both in eating and Drinking; and therefore it is oppoſed to Hungry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 21. And this more large ſenſe we may alſo ſpeak to in what follows: Though I principally intend to ſpeak of <hi>Wine,</hi> in the two firſt conſiderations mentioned, or in the ſecond, in and under which the firſt is compriſed. And ſo much to the firſt Enquiry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What it is [to be Drunk] with Wine, and when a man may be ſaid ſo to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this we ſay, That to be Drunk with <hi>Wine,</hi> of which we are here admoniſhed, and from which dehorted, doth ſignify:</p>
            <p n="1">1. More then Drinking <hi>Wine</hi> ſparingly: Though a man cannot be Drunk without
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48912:13"/>
drinking; yet he may drink and not be Drunk: we are not forbidden to uſe <hi>Wine,</hi> as is before ſaid; but may drink a little law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, if we have wherewith to buy it, or it be given to us; and that for our delight alſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 25, 26, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 15, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 34. And in ſome caſes, and for ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it may be needful, as in caſe of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and for the Stomacks ſake, as the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Timothy: Drink no longer Water, but uſe a little Wine for thy Stomacks ſake, and for thy oft infirmities,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 23. So again, <hi>Give Strong Drink to him that is ready to periſh, and Wine to thoſe that be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Soul, or heavy of heart,</hi> Prov. 31. 6, 7, 2 Sam. 16. 2. But that of which we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of is, of the abuſe of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor are men by this dehortation, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden a more liberal uſe of <hi>Wine</hi> at ſome times, and upon ſome ſpecial and extraordinary occaſions, when they may have it lawfully, without abuſing themſelves, or others, or the good Creatures of God: Thus it is recorded of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Brethren, that they drank, and they drank largely together, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 34. And at a Marriage where Chriſt was, and his Diſciples, when they had well drank, he by a Miracle turned Water into <hi>Wine,</hi> of which beſt <hi>Wine</hi> they alſo drank, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1-10. But both were extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; the former in expreſſion of <hi>Joſephs</hi> joy for the company of his Brethren, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48912:13"/>
eſpecially of his Brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy love to them, and to ſhew them his honour and greatneſs God had advanced him to: The latter, that Chriſt, the truth of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> might ſhew forth his Glory by this Miracle, and his Diſciples be confirmed in their Faith in him: and others alſo might be drawn in to believe on him, ſeeing this great and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous work of his, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 11, 23-25, and ſo not to be ordinarily practiſed by men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But the Drunkenneſs here admoniſhed of, and dehorted from, is, when perſons are filled with <hi>Wine</hi> (as appears by the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the latter part of the verſe) and drink to exceſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 12. And ſo they may be ſaid to be Drunk who are overcome with <hi>Wine,</hi> as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom Wine hath overcome, becauſe of the Lord, and becauſe of the words of his holineſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 9. So the Prophet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Drunkards of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> ſaith, <hi>They are ſuch as are overcome with Wine,</hi> Iſa. 28. 1. And, <hi>Of whom, or of what a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought into bondage,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 19, Or, when men are deceived therewith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 1, or, turned aſide out of the right way thereby; as it is ſaid of the Drunkards of <hi>Ehpraim, They have erred through Wine, and through Strong Drink are out of the way: the Prieſt and the Prophet have erred through Strong Drink—they are out of the way through
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48912:14"/>
String Drink,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 7. And ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly we may ſay, there are degrees in this Drunkenneſs, and of all we are admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some perſons are ſaid to be very drunken, as it ſaid of <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 36, and ſo drunken as that they fall, not being able to go through much Drink: and together here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with uſually, or often-times, they ſpue and vomit, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 27: thus it is ſaid of the Drunkards of <hi>Ephraim, All Tables are full of vomit and filthineſs, ſo that there is no place clean, Iſa.</hi> 28. 7, 8, and 19. 14, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 26. Or make themſelves naked, <hi>and diſcover their nakedneſs, even that of their Fore-skin alſo, to their ſhame, Gen.</hi> 9. 21-23, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 21, <hi>Habbak.</hi> 2. 15, 16, and ſo are wholly bereft of their underſtanding, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 24, and 19. 31-35. When men are ſo overcome, they are as, or worſe than, bruit beaſts: And all will acknowledg ſuch are guilty of this bruitiſh and heatheniſh Iniquity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or men may be ſaid to be Drunk, when they are not ſo far overcome with <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> as the former; and yet are diſtempered therewith, and behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after an unuſual manner by reaſon thereof: As when perſons though they can go, and have not drunk ſo much, or <hi>Drink</hi> hath not prevailed ſo far upon them, as to fall, and wallow in their filth, as the Dog in his vomit, or Swine in the mire; yet they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48912:14"/>
cannot go ſteddily, but reel to and fro, and ſtaggar through <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> which are evidences of Drunkenneſs alſo, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declareth to us: ſo it is ſaid, <hi>They reel to and fro, and ſtagger like a drunken man, Pſal.</hi> 107. 27, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 20, <hi>Job</hi> 12. 25. <hi>As a drunken man ſtaggerth, Iſa.</hi> 19. 14, and 29. 9. Or, when men ſhout or make an unuſual noiſe by reaſon of <hi>Wine, Pſal.</hi> 78. 65, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 9. 15, or by reaſon of <hi>Strong Drink</hi> are ready to quarrel with, and offer wrong to others that are about them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3; or otherwiſe by the ſtrength of <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Strong Drink</hi> do behave themſelves ſtrangely, or alter an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed manner: as by exceſſive Mirth, Laughter, Talking, being heavy to Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13, 14, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10-12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea, they are guilty of this iniquity alſo, who drink till <hi>Wine</hi> inflame them, though outwardly they may behave themſelves well enough, and may not be diſcerned by others to be overcome with <hi>Wine:</hi> and who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon their Luſts, and devour what is given to them to another end, even to live in the uſe and enjoyment thereof, to the will of God: (for ſome men may devour and bear much more <hi>Strong Drink</hi> than others, and not be taken notice of): So men are ſaid to do that for Drunkenneſs, which is not done for ſtrength, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 17. And a Wo is pronounced upon them that riſe up early in the morning that they may follow <hi>Strong
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48912:15"/>
Drink,</hi> that continue until night, till <hi>Wine</hi> inflame, or purſue them: <hi>And, Wo to them that are mighty to drink Wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drink,</hi> Iſa. 5. 11, 12, 22: and ſo men may be guilty of this iniquity whoſe hearts are over-charged with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, though their outward-man appear to be well enough, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34: and generally they are guilty of this evil, who pamper the fleſh, and make proviſion for the luſts thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>And the Drunkenneſs here admoniſhed of, is not only of the higheſt degree thereof; But of all intemperance and inſobriety what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: And not only are we dehorted from the habit of Drunkenneſs, or accuſtoming our ſelves to exceſs; but from any, and every one particular act. It is true indeed, the evil is ſtill the greater when men ſin in an high, or the higheſt degree; and accuſtom themſelves to ſuch a bruitiſh Iniquity: But yet it is a provoking evil to God, and that of which we are admoniſhed, to be at any one time polluted herewith, and deceived hereby. Therefore our Saviour ſaith to his Diſciples; <hi>Take heed to your ſelves leſt [at any time] your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeting and drunkenneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34, and the rather we ſhould take heed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not only becauſe it is a provoking Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it ſelf; but becauſe <hi>Wine</hi> is a mocker and deceiver of men: many times men think
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48912:15"/>
to drink but a little, and <hi>Wine</hi> deceives them till they are overcome therewith, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thereby; or perſons think, if for once they ſhould be overtaken, yet they will not make a trade of it: Truly if they do not, yet that once is a provoking evil. And yet uſually men are deceived; for when they are once overcome, they are more eaſily inticed, and deceived again and again, and ſo brought into bondage, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. It is ſuch a Cord, as that when a man is taken therewith, it is an hard thing to diſentangle himſelf again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 22: and therefore whoſoever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thereby, though but very ſeldom, or once, is not wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 1. Good therefore it is for us, to abſtain from every kind and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of this evil, as well as of others, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22. And thus we have ſpoken to this ſecond Inquiry, and ſhewn in ſome meaſure what it is <hi>[to be Drunk]</hi> with <hi>Wine,</hi> and when men may be ſaid ſo to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We come in the next place to note ſome Inſtructions which are contained in this admonition and dehortation of the Apoſtles: as to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">I. From the perſons to whom it is given, ſo we may note; That ſuch perſons as have heard and believed the word of truth, the Goſpel of our ſalvation, and after they have believed, have been ſealed with the Holy Spirit of promiſe, unto the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; need to be admoniſhed and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48912:16"/>
of being <hi>Drunk with Wine:</hi> Such manner of perſons theſe were to whom the Apoſtle here writeth, as appears, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14, and 2. 5-10, and 4. 30, and 5. 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet to theſe he gives this admonition, and ſaith, <hi>Be not drunk with Wine.</hi> So our Saviour gives alike admonition to his Diſciples; <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs,</hi> Luke 21. 34. Thus alſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who were <hi>the called of Jeſus Chriſt, beloved of God, &amp;c.</hi> yet to them he ſaith, including himſelf alſo, <hi>Let us walk honeſtly—not in rioting and drunkenneſs,</hi> Rom. 1. 6-8, and <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. And to the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> on whoſe behalf he gave thanks to God alwayes, <hi>Remembring without ceaſing their work of Faith, and labour of love, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of hope—knowing their election of God:</hi> Yet to them he ſaith, <hi>Let us not ſleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſober: For they that ſleep, ſleep in the night; and they that are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, are drunken in the night: But let us—be ſober,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 2-4, with <hi>ch.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6-8. Yea the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did keep under his body, and brought it into ſujection, leſt that by any means when he had preached to others, he himſelf ſhould become a caſt-away, or reprobate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. And it may further appear, that hearty and unſeigned Believers, and all of them, need to be admoniſhed of, and dehorted from this iniquity of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48912:16"/>
1. They are not wholly ſpiritual, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carnal, yea ſome more carnal than ſpiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1-4: They have ſtill ſin in them, and the luſts thereof annoying them, both hindring them from what is good, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing them to what is evil: To which ſin and its luſts they are naturally apt to ſow, and to ſide with them: Therefore they need to have and ſuffer the word of exhortation, and thoſe warnings given by the Holy Ghoſt. Thus the Apoſtle complaineth, <hi>I am carnal, ſold under ſin: And when I would do good, evil is preſent with me,</hi> Rom. 7. 14-24. And the Prophet complains with grief and ſorrow; <hi>I am ready to halt, and my ſorrow is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before me; For I will declare mine iniquity, and be ſorry for my ſin,</hi> Pſal. 38. 17, 18, <hi>And mine iniquities prevail againſt me,</hi> Pſal. 65. 3. Hence ſuch Exhortations and Commandments are given to us by the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Mortify your members that are upon the earth,</hi> Col. 3. 5. as ſignifying, the affections and luſts of the fleſh are our Members, the members of the Old-man. <hi>And the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. <hi>Abſtain from fleſhly luſts that war againſt the Soul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11, and 4. 3-7, <hi>Do ye think,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, that the Scripture ſaith in vain, the ſpirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to envy, even to all that is evil and forbidden of God?</hi> And it ſaith not this in vain; but it therefore thus ſpeaketh, that we might take heed to our ſpirit, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48912:17"/>
we truſt not therein, or thereto: and that we follow not after it, nor obey it in the luſts thereof, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 1, 3-5, with <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15, 16, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 3. If there were no ſin in them, but they were perfect as to attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wholly ſinleſs (as ſome ungodly ſpirits boaſt of themſelves, who yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs) there would be no ſuch need for their being ſo admoniſhed and warned of this iniquity: But alas! it is not ſo with them: <hi>For if we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and</hi> (inſtead of having no ſin in us) <hi>the truth is not in us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8: and this amongſt other things, he did write to the Believers, not to ſtrengthen them in any evil wayes, or to plead for ſin, but that they might not ſin, but might lay apart all filthineſs and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of naughtineſs, and receive with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ingraffed word, which is able to ſave their Souls, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, with <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 8-10, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14-20, that they might not truſt in their own heart: <hi>He that truſteth therein is a fool,</hi> Prov. 28. 26. <hi>For every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil, and that continually,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. <hi>From within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts</hi> (of all things) <hi>adulteries, fornication, murders, thefts, covetouſneſs, wickedneſs, deceit, laſciviouſneſs, an evil eye, blaſphemy, pride, fooliſhneſs: All theſe evil things come from within, and defile the man,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48912:17"/>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 17-20, 21-23. Therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their great carnality, and natural inclination and propenſity to all evil, they need to be admoniſhed of, and dehorted from all evil, and particularly from Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have alſo enemies without them, who are tempting them to what is evil, and particularly to this iniquity here warned of, even to this of intemperance.</p>
            <p>Namely, Satan, the god of this world, who is eminently and emphatically called, <hi>The Tempter, Matth.</hi> 4. 1-3, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 5. And he is endeavouring by all means to tempt and entice them to all that is evil, eſpecially the Believers, that he might turn them aſide to crooked paths, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 1-5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. He is their great enemy, and only adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who are ſeeking after, and ſerving the Lord: and is therefore uſing all wayes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to entice them to evil, and tempt them to do his Luſts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. And as at firſt he decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and deſtroyed our firſt Parents, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to eat the forbidden Fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3, ſo ſtill he endeavours to corrupt and deſtroy men, by cauſing them to tranſgreſs in Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking contrary to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 4, 5, He tempts men to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſobriety and Intemperance. Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be Sober, be vigilant: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Devil your adverſary as a roaring Lion walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48912:18"/>
Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>And the men of the World who lye in wickedneſs, and under the power of the Wicked-one, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19, they are promoting and carrying an-end Satans deſign in the World, and endeavouring to turn the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers out of the right way: Hence the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God counſelleth, <hi>My Son, if Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners entice thee, conſent thou not—Walk not thou in the way with them, refrain thy foot from their path,</hi> Prov. 1. 10-15. They will, both by their evil counſel in words, and by their practice alſo, entice the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to have fellowſhip with them in their unfruitful works of darkneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11: and think it ſtrange if they will not run with them to the ſame exceſs of Riot, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil of them: And therefore alſo they need to be admoniſhed of Intemperance, and exhorted to <hi>be ſober, and watch unto Prayer,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 3, 4-7, Yea, and ſome, and too many there are of the Leaders of the people, who endeavour to cauſe others to err, even to err through <hi>Wine,</hi> ſuch there are, who walking in the Spirit (the evil one) and Falſhood, do lye, Propheſying unto them of <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Strong Drink, Micah</hi> 2. 11, <hi>Come ye, ſay they, I will fetch Wine</hi> (they can debaſe themſelves to Hell in the ſervice of their Luſts) <hi>and we will fill our ſelves with Strong Drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant,</hi> Iſa. 56. 10-12:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48912:18"/>
Therefore they need alſo to be admoniſhed to take heed and beware of this Iniquity of Drunkenneſs; becauſe they have not only ſuch a ſecret and homebred enemy within them; but ſo many powerful, vigilant ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without them alſo, who will deceive, if poſſible, even the very Elect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They need alſo to be admoniſhed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; Becauſe it is a very brutiſh and heinous Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, a very ſinful and provoking Iniquity in the ſight of God; yea, and of men alſo generally, until they are given up to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and become paſt feeling. It is a great and heinous Iniquity againſt God, ſuch as in which men more openly and manifeſtly do rebel againſt the light, than in many other evils of which they are admoniſhed: And therefore in the ſervice hereof, they render themſelves openly to be Children of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,</hi> Children of the Devil, Lawleſs perſons, ſuch as will do whatſoever is right in their own eyes, in deſpight of, and in direct and open oppoſition unto the Light in the Teſtimony, and to that wiſdom and underſtanding God indues men with, whereby he teacheth them more than the Beaſts of the Earth, and makes them wiſer than the Fowls of Heaven, <hi>Job.</hi> 35. 10, 11. Hence when <hi>Hannah</hi> was wrongfully ſuſpected to be guilty of this Iniquity, ſhe thus ſpeaketh to clear her ſelf: <hi>My Lord—I have drunk neither Wine, nor Srong drink—Count not thine Hand-maid
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48912:19"/>
for a Daughter of Belial:</hi> Think me not to be, reckon me not as a Drunkard; for ſuch are Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> eſpecially if of the Female Sex: In which is intimated to us the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minableneſs of this Iniquity, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 14-16. And in committing this Iniquity, men even work the will of the Heathen: as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifieth in ſaying, <hi>The time paſt of our life may ſuffice us to have wrought the will of the Heathen, or Gentiles</hi> (which know not God) <hi>when we walked in laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—exceſs of wine, revellings, banquetings,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3, with 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 4, 5. And the Holy Ghoſt, to ſet forth the abominableneſs of this Iniquity, and that of the Luſt of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs (the conſequent and concomitant of it, as we ſhall ſhew) makes uſe of the names of theſe ſins to repreſent and deſcribe abominable Idolatry by: Read <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 2, and 18. 3. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 7. And it is a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Iniquity amongſt men generally (and therefore they do, or however did, in former times, commit it in the night, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 7.) and ſuch an one as they will abominate and lothe in others, and teſtify their diſlike of (until they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come paſt feeling) and diſpleaſure againſt. Thus under the Law, the way to render ones Son vile to others, was to ſay, He was guilty of intemperance; as it is written, <hi>The Parents ſhall ſay unto the Elders of the City, This our Son is ſtubborn and rebellious, he

            <p n="4">4.

And threatens to bring upon them Forreiners to waſt and deſtroy them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 11-14. 22-25-30. Yea indeed, he is many times ſo provoked to anger with men on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as that, eſpecially if they continue in this iniquity, he cuts them off, even in their ſin of Drunkenneſs; as may be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated unto us in what is ſaid by the Prophet, <hi>The Lord will make an utter end, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall not riſe up the ſecond time.

            </p>
            <p>And this Inſtruction, as thus ſpoken unto, may be of uſefulneſs to us:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſhew unto us, That the believers themſelves are not, while in mortal bodies, perfect as to attainment, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. But they have ſtill the Old-man which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48912:20"/>
to the deceitful Luſts thereof; which though Crucified with Chriſt, yet is not whoſly deſtroyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. Therefore are they inſtructed and incouraged, through the Spirit to mortify (continually) the deeds of the Body, that they may live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>There is a Generation indeed that are pure, and ſinleſs in their own eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs. There is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, O how lofty are their eyes, and their eye-lids are lifted up, Prov.</hi> 30. 12, 13. But it is not ſo with them that walk in the light, as God is in the light: they ſee by the light of Gods teſtimony, and prove by experience, that they have ſin within them, and many fleſhly luſts that war againſt the Soul; to abſtain from daily ungodlineſs, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts to deny and renounce: And the conſideration hereof cauſeth them to cry out, <hi>O wretched men that we are, who ſhall deliver us from this body of death? Rom.</hi> 7. 14-24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. And this leads them to pity others, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſhews unto us the mercy of God in giving gifts unto men: and fitting them to go before others in the Word of the Lord, and to warn them of every path of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer: and ſuch ſhould not be deſpiſed, but eſteemed by us, who are faithful in admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing us of that which is evil and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto him, who is of purer eyes than to behold Iniquity. Thus when the Apoſtle
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48912:21"/>
had been warning the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and inſtructing them to Sobriety, he gives this exhortation to them: <hi>And we beſeech you, Brethren, to know them which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you</hi> (to wit, among other things of Drunkenneſs, and Inſobriety, as appears by the ſcope of the place): <hi>And to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 6, 7, 8-12, 13: for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever deſpiſeth them in their faithful admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and dehortations, deſpiſeth not Man but God, who alſo hath given unto them his Holy Spirit to accompany and aſſiſt them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 2-4-8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Seeing ſuch need to be dehorted from this Iniquity of Drunkenneſs, we may learn from hence, That they are no friends to them, nor is this love in any, whatever pretenſions and profeſſions they have, and make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who entice them to this great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Iniquity: They need not be provoked to Inſobriety (for we are all too forward there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to naturally) but dehorted therefrom: And therefore it is not loving-kindneſs, but hating<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs to urge any to eat or drink intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately; and ſuch an Iniquity as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God is provoked: <hi>Wo unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that putteſt thy bottle to him, and makeſt him drunken alſo, that thou mayeſt look on their nakedneſs. Thou art filled more with ſhame than with glory,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48912:21"/>
Habbak. 2. 15, 16. Though men may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this to be liberality, and to tend to their glory, yet it will appear in concluſion, that ſuch glory is their ſhame; and that they <hi>call evil good, and good evil; put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs,</hi> Iſa. 5. 20-22. <hi>And time will come, when the vile perſon ſhall no more be called liberoel,</hi> Iſa. 32. 5. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever appearance of love ſuch may have to us, yet indeed it is, and is to be eſteemed hatred by us; for, <hi>Love worketh no ill to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Let us then caſt off theſe works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and walk honeſtly—not in rioting and drunkenneſs,</hi> Rom. 13. 8-10-13; and rather eſteem them to be our friends, and reckon them to be lovers of us, and kind to us, whoſe work it is to endeavour to preſerve us from this, and all other crooked-paths whatſoever, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The conſideration hereof might hide Pride from them, and help them, <hi>Not to be high minded, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11. 20. <hi>Happy is the man that feareth alwayes: but he that hardneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchief,</hi> Prov. 28. 14. Truly, even the Believers have great cauſe to ſtand in awe, and not to ſin: for they have ſin in them, and many enemies that ſeek the hurt of them; and too readily and frequently they offend in many things; and therefore it behoves them to fear the Commandment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 13: And ſuffer the word of Exhortation; and not to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48912:22"/>
think themſelves to be ſo ſtrong, or wiſe, as that they need no ſuch admonitions: But rather to be alwayes jealous of themſelves, and to ſeed themſelves, to eat and drink with fear, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 12, <hi>The wiſe man feareth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from evil, but the fool rageth and is confident,</hi> Prov. 14. 16. Yea indeed, it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially behoves them to flee from Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and avoid all occaſions thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this Inſtruction and Counſel given by Wiſdom to her Children: <hi>Hear thou my Son, and be wiſe, and guide thine heart in the way: be not amongst Wine-bibbers,</hi> Prov. 23. 19, 20. And this leads us to a ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from theſe words. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. In that he ſaith <hi>[Be not ye drunk with Wine]</hi> ſo he ſignifieth to us; That it doth eſpecially behove them who have heard and believed the word of Truth, the Goſpel of our Salvation, to flee from Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs; and if they do not ſo, their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity will be greater, more provoking, and inexcuſable than others, and their judgment more terrible, and intolerable: Hence to ſuch, and from the conſideration of their nighneſs to, and mercy they have received from God, he thus ſpeaks: <hi>This I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and testify in the Lord, that</hi> [Ye] <hi>walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,</hi> Eph. 4. 17-20. So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you as Strangers and Pilgrims, abſtain from fleſhly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48912:22"/>
luſts which war againſt the Soul: having your converſation honeſt,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9-12. And this will appear if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are called out of darkneſs (out of ignorance and blindneſs) into Gods mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. And therefore it more abundantly behoves them to put off, and flee from this work of darkneſs: <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſs</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to theſe believing <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and then ye walked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of this world, &amp;c.) <hi>but now are ye light in the Lord, walk as children of light:</hi> walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their minds, having the underſtanding darkned; being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8, with <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 1, 2, and 4. 17, 18. <hi>Indeed, this is the condemnation</hi> (as to men generally, this is their condemning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, and the cauſe of their condemnation) <hi>that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil,</hi> Joh. 3. 19, 20. But now as to theſe, not only light is come into the world, but they are turned from Darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, as to their ſtate: they have believed in the light, and are the children of it, born of it, and called into it, indued with the light of the knowledg of God, which ſhines in the face of Chriſt: and therefore it behoves them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48912:23"/>
eſpecially to avoid, and abſtain from all evil, and from this of Intemperance particularly, or elſe they will more highly ſin and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the light than others: Chriſt hath given them light: let ſuch <hi>ſee then that they walk circumſpectly, not as fools but as wiſe—Let them not be drunk with Wine,</hi> Eph. 5. 15-18. Certainly men act as, and render themſelves to be fools, at an high rate, eſpecially the Children of Light, who are <hi>Drunk with Wine;</hi> and ſuch deeds are directly and openly oppoſite to the Light they have received, and to that Wiſdom they are indued with: As on the other hand, it is an high point of Wiſdom, and the way to be more wiſe ſtill, for thoſe who are of the light, to avoid <hi>Wine</hi> wherein is exceſs, and ſuch as are Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof: Hence the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>My Son, if thine heart be wiſe, mine heart ſhall rejoyce, even mine; yea my reins ſhall rejoyce,</hi> &amp;c. But how may the heart of ſuch an one be wiſe? Wherein conſiſts, and what is the way to Wiſdom? The Wiſdom of God informs us of this, as one thing contained in it, and needful to it: <hi>Hear thou my Son, and be wiſe, and guide thine heart in the Way: Be not amongſt wine-bibbers, amongſt riotous eaters of fleſh,</hi> Prov. 23. 15-21. This Argument the Apoſtle alſo propounds to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> to move them to be, and abide Sober. <hi>Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day; We are not of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48912:23"/>
night nor of darkneſs: Therefore let us not ſleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: For they that ſleep ſleep in the night, and they that are drunken are drunken in the night: But let us who are of the day be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 5-8. And if they be not ſo who are Children of light, but become the ſervants of corruption, as their ſin is more ſinful than others, ſo their judgment will be much more ſevere and intollerable: For ſuch as theſe <hi>The blackneſs of darkneſs is reſerved for ever,</hi> Jude 12, 13. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered to them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 19-22. The Apoſtle gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Iniquity of Intemperance in thoſe who are Children of Light, is greater than that of other men: and anſwerably their judgement and puniſhment will be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier and more terrible, if they be not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably waſhed therefrom; in that he ſaith, <hi>I wrote unto you in an Epiſtle, not to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with fornicators: yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For then muſt ye needs go out of the world. But now I have written unto you,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48912:24"/>
not to keep company: If any that is called a Brother be a fornicator—or a Drunkard—with ſuch an one, no not to eat:</hi> not familiarly to converſe, or not to eat at the Table of the Lord with ſuch an one as this is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9-11: Becauſe ſuch ſin ſo greatly againſt the Light, and act ſo very uuſutably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe principles which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of God, in walking according where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they would certainly be preſerved from ſuch a brutiſh and beaſtly Iniquity as is this of Drunkenneſs and Intemperance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe are Saints by calling and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, waſhed, and ſanctified in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of our God, and ſo are brought nigh unto God: <hi>They are no more ſtrangers and forreiners, but fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God: And in Chriſt they are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit;</hi> And ſo are made nigh unto him by the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13-19-22. They are brought into, and made of his Houſe: <hi>And holineſs becometh thy houſe, O Lord, for ever,</hi> Pſal. 93. 5. And therefore it doth behove theſe eſpecially to eſcape and flee from the corruptions of the world, and this alſo particularly of Inſobriety; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they will more abundantly provoke the eyes of his Glory, unto whom they are made ſo nigh. <hi>Be not unequally yoaked together with unbelievers; For what fellowſhip hath
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48912:24"/>
righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs? and what communion hath light with darkneſs? And what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> (whoſe Children Drunkards are, as we have ſeen) <hi>Or what part hath he that believeth, with an Infidel? And what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? For ye are the Temple of the living God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if any man defile the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy; For the Temple of God is holy, which Temple ye are,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14-16, with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16, 17. The Lord will be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in them that come nigh him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 3, though he hateth ſin with a perfect and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting hatred in all. God is of purer eyes than to behold Iniquity, yet it is more bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or rather not ſo unbearable and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto him, to ſee thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his houſe, and at a diſtance from him, to purſue and follow this brutiſh and ſwiniſh Iniquity, than to ſee men that are brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Houſe vomit and ſpue there, even in his preſence: theſe are more abundantly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to him, and cauſe a ſtink in his noſe which he cannot away with. This was an aggravation of the Iniquity of his people in former times, as the Prophet gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: <hi>I am like a drunken man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and like a man whom wine hath overcome—for in mine houſe have I found their wickedneſs, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 9-11. <hi>They came
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48912:25"/>
into my Sanctuary to defile it; and lo thus have they done in the midſt of mine houſe—And a voice of the multitude being at eaſe was with her, and with the men of the common ſort were brought Sabeans,</hi> or Drunkards, &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 38 42. His houſe is, and ſhould be holy, an houſe of Prayer and Sacrifice: But how unſeemly and provoking an Iniquity is it unto him, when his people make it a den of Drunkards! He needs not, nor can endure it, that mad men, ſuch as are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with <hi>Wine,</hi> ſhould come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 14, 15, with <hi>Jer.</hi> 5 1. 7.). They are a Spiritual houſe, an Holy Nation, a peculiar People, or people for a poſſeſſion; therefore they eſpecially ſhould, and it behoves them highly to, abſtain from fleſhly luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4-9-11: they eſpecially ſhould come out from among men, and be ſeparate, and touch no unclean thing: for the Lord their God walketh in the midſt of them to deliver them, and to give up their enemies before them; therefore they ſhould be holy, that he ſee no unclean thing in them, and turn away from them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14-17, with <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 14, and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13, 14, and 2. 1. As he who hath called them is Holy, ſo ſhould they be Holy in all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; or otherwiſe, if they grow fat with the fat of the Kidneys of Wheat, and with the pure blood of the Grape, and kick againſt God; when he ſees this, he will abhor
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48912:25"/>
them, becauſe of the provoking of his Sons, and of his Daughters: and he will hide his face from them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 14-20. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves them therefore, who are brought ſo nigh unto him, to receive this admonition, and obey this word of exhortation; or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe their Iniquity will be greater and more provoking than others; and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; their judgment will be more ſevere and intollerable. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity, as becomes Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They eſpecially ought to flee from this Iniquity alſo, otherwiſe they will do more hurt to others, and teach and ſtrengthen the wicked-ones in their ways, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 33, they are the light of the world; therefore they are inſtructed to let their light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee their good works, and glorify their Father which is in Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 14-16. Needful it is for them eſpecially, to take heed that they put not a ſtumbling-block before the blind, not to eat fleſh, nor drink Wine, nor any thing whereby their Brother (for whom alſo Chriſt died) ſtumbleth, or is offended: <hi>Curſed is he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way, Levit.</hi> 19. 14. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 21. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 18. Thoſe who have known, and believed the Teſtimony that God hath given of his Son, are ſet, and preſerved to ſhine as lights in the midſt of a crooked
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48912:26"/>
and froward generation, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 12-15. And to that end, to hold forth the Word of life, in word and converſation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. And if they walk on in Darkneſs, in Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drunkenneſs, and the conſequents thereof; Oh how will they thereby do hurt to others! By means of them the name of God, and his doctrine, will be blaſphemed and reproached by others, as if it were a Doctrine of Profaneneſs and Licentiouſneſs: and they hereby lay ſtumbling-blocks in the way of poor ignorant ones, ſo as none will return from, but rather be ſtrengthened in their evil wayes. And, <hi>Wo to the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of offences; but wo to the man,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>by whom the offence cometh. Wherefore if thy hand or foot</hi> (any work or walking of thine) <hi>cauſe thee to offend, cut them off, and caſt them from thee: It is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands, or feet, to be caſt into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire; where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched,</hi> Matth. 18. 7-9, Mark 9. 43-45. They are a City ſet on an hill, which cannot be hid; and every one is obſerving, and taking notice of them, and their demeanour and converſation: And therefore it behoves them eſpecially, to have their <hi>Converſation honeſt among the Gentiles,</hi> (which they cannot have, unleſs they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from fleſhly luſts which war againſt the Souls of others, as well as againſt their own):
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48912:26"/>
               <hi>that whereas they ſpeak againſt them as evil doers, they may by the good works which they ſhall behold, glorify God in the day of viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11, 12, and <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 16. It behoves them therefore to have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, that they may be pure from the blood of other men, and that the blood of their Souls be not required of them.</p>
            <p>And as it behoves the Believers in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to receive this admonition given unto them, and to obey the counſel therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: ſo ſtill it more highly concerns thoſe amongſt them, who are over them, and go before them, to abſtain, and flee from all intemperance whatſoever, whether in meat or drink. The Apoſtle was very careful, when he gives Commandment about ſuch as ſhould be choſen into the Office of a Biſhop, or Elder, that he that ſhould be choſen thereinto, ſhould not be given to this Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Inſobriety: <hi>A Biſhop,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>muſt be blameleſs—not given to wine,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 3. 1-3. So to <hi>Titus</hi> alſo, he ſaith, <hi>If any be blameleſs—not accuſed of riot,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs—not given to wine,</hi> Tit. 1. 6, 7. And the ſame direction he gives concerning Deacons alſo; <hi>Likewiſe muſt the Deacons be grave, not given to much wine,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 8, they are to be examples to the Believers, in word and converſation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. And in all things to ſhew
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48912:27"/>

And if they depart out of the way, they will cauſe many to ſtumble at the Law: and God will make them contemptible and baſe before all the people, according as they have not kept his wayes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 8, 9; it behoves them therefore to be temperate in all things, and to keep under their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and bring them into ſubjection, leſt when they have preached to others, they themſelves become reprobates, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24-27. They have ſome peculiar ſervice in bearing the veſſels of the Lord, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; and they therefore ſhould be clean, which they cannot be, unleſs they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theſe worldly luſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 11, with <hi>ch.</hi> 28. 8. This was a Complaint taken up, and uttered forth againſt the leaders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in former times: <hi>The Prieſt amd the Prophet have erred through Strong Drink, they are ſwallowed up of Wine, they are out of the way through Strong Drink,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 7.—They are in their ſervice brought high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> than their Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: And therefore he will, moſt eſpecially, be ſanctified in them: And it greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them at all times to be temperate, eſpecially when they approach unto him, leſt through their inſobriety they offer up ſtrange fire inſtead of that of the Altar. It may ſeem this evil of Intemperance was found
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48912:27"/>
with <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and that it was the cauſe of their miſcarriage: Therefore for the future God gives a ſtrict charge, that thoſe that come near to him ſhould abſtain from this occaſion of evil: For upon that occaſion the Lord ſpake to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Do not drink wine, nor ſtrong drink, thou, nor thy Sons with thee, when ye go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, leſt ye dye: It ſhall be a ſtatute for ever throughout your generations; And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean,</hi> (in which <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> ſailed). See <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1-3-8-10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 21-23. This may and will cauſe men to follow their own Spirit, and to ſpeak things to God which they ought not.——They are to be Gods mouth to the people in ſome ſort, and are to ſpeak his words, and make known and open his Doctrine to them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoves them greatly to take heed, and beware that they be not overcome of <hi>Wine;</hi> that they may teach his <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 8-11. <hi>For by the exceſs of wine they will err in viſion, and ſtumble in judgment,</hi> Iſa. 28. 7. They are to watch for the Souls of thoſe which are committed to their charge: their work is to be watch-men: But alas, how greatly will this Intemperance unfit them for it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to ſlothfulneſs and ſleepineſs! This will unfil them for the ſervice they are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48912:28"/>

It will make them blind, ignorant, fooliſh-ones, and render them altogether unmeet for the work of watch-men: hence it is ſaid, <hi>His watch-men are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; ſleeping, lying down, loving to ſlumber—Come ye, ſay they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink: and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant,</hi> Iſa. 56. 9-12.—They ſhould be reprovers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſhould admoniſh and warn them of every path of the Deſtroyer, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 17-26. But if they themſelves be guilty of Drunkenneſs, how ſhould they warn others of Intemperance, or reprove them for it? Thou that ſayeſt another ſhould not be Drunk, or commit Fornication, art thou thy ſelf Intemperate, and unclean? <hi>Thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf?

But alas! How will this Swiniſh Iniquity unfit men for this, and hinder them from exerciſing themſelves to what is good and profitable to themſelves and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! And do not ſuch ſometimes complain, they are ſo ſtraitned by reaſon of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48912:28"/>
and imployments, that they cannot be ſo oft with their Brethren as they would be; when yet the ſame perſons can too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find time to diſtemper themſelves, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the good Creatures of God: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cauſe others to abhor the Ordinances and Appointments of the Lord: Yea, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as we have ſaid) God makes them baſe and contemptible before all the people; And they are juſtly taken up in the lips of talkers. Oh how provoking an Iniquity is this in ſuch as theſe are! And unto ſuch the Lord alſo may ſpeak, and ſay, <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Covenant in thy mouth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou hateſt inſtruction, and caſteſt my words behind thee?</hi> Pſal. 50. 16-20-22, And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the provokingneſs of this Iniquity in them, is ſignified in Gods ſeverity againſt them. <hi>If that ſervant ſay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming, and ſhall begin to beat the men-ſervants, and the maidens, and to eat and drink with the drmnken,</hi> or, to be drunken: <hi>The Lord of that Servant ſhall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of: and ſhall cut him in ſunder, and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites and unbelievers: there ſhall be weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth.

III. Conſidering the time when this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and admonition was given to theſe Believers, we may learn ſomewhat from thence which may be inſtructive to us from this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. And ſo, as we may ſee, it was given unto them <hi>[When the dayes were evil,</hi> Eph. 5. 16.] Now they may be ſaid to be evil, in a double conſideration, whereto we ſhall here briefly ſpeak, and ſo note ſomething for our learning: As to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The dayes or time may be ſaid to be evil, when they are ſinful times, when Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity doth abound, and that both Spiritual and Carnal. The dayes are evil, ſinfully evil, and perilous times, when men have a form of Godlineſs over all their Impiety and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1-5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 12. As well as alſo they are ſaid to be evil, when more groſs impiety, and carnal wickedneſs abound. As when the words of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the profeſſed people of God, are ſo ſtout, as they ſay, <hi>It is vain to ſerve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and that we have walked mournfully before him?</hi> as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14, 15: or when they run to all exceſs of Riot, and commit Iniquity with greedineſs: So it was ſaid to be an evil time, when the Lord ſaith, <hi>I know your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold tranſgreſſions, and your mighty ſins,</hi> Amos 5. 12, 13. And ſo it appears, the times or dayes in this place, were ſaid to be evil, becauſe of the abounding of groſs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48912:30"/>
wickedneſs: many amongſt them did commit uncleanneſs with greedineſs; and were act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfruitful works of darkneſs, ſuch as it was a ſhame to ſpeak of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 16-19. and <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The dayes may be ſaid to be evil, when they are full of affliction, and when God is executing his judgments upon the earth: So as, <hi>All the dayes of the afflicted are evil,</hi> Prov. 16. 15. So the Prophet imprecates, <hi>Bring upon them the day of evil,</hi> Jer. 17. 17, 18. And ſo the dayes, or times, are frequently, and moſt frequently ſaid to be evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 12. and 12. 1. <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Micah</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 34. And from this double underſtanding we may take notice of theſe two inſtructions from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the time, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">[1.] That when the dayes are ſinfully evil, then eſpecially the Believers need to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to ſlee from Intemperance, and exceſs of <hi>Wine:</hi> And it behoves them then more abundantly to receive the admonition, <hi>Not to be drunk with Wine:</hi> And this will appear if we conſider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. In ſuch dayes and times they have more temptations and provocations by the general evil example of others: Therefore they the more need this admonition to be given to, and received by them, when Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is ſo generally and frequently practiſed by thoſe amongſt whom we live, and is ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48912:30"/>
openly acted and committed by them. Hence the Lord giveth this admonition to his people in former times: <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to do evil,</hi> Exod. 23. 2. In which he ſignifies, that in ſuch a day we ſhall have more ſtrong provocations to have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them in thoſe unfruitful works of darkneſs, than when Iniquity ſtops her mouth, and hides her head, and a greater inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto: And this alſo appeareth by what Gods profeſſed people plead for the ſervice of their ſins: Namely, the general and open example of their Fathers, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones: <hi>We will do,</hi> ſay they, <hi>what ſoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incenſe to the Queen of Heaven—as we have done, we, and our Fathers, our Kings, and our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in the Cities of Judah, and in the ſtreets of Jeruſalem,</hi> Jer. 44. 15-17. When men generally declare their ſin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide it not, Oh then we need eſpecially, and it greatly concerns us to receive, and obey this admonition given to us. Then we ſhall have many to entice, and urge us, by their word and example, to conſent to them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them, in their crooked paths; and to run with them to the ſame exceſs of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot whereto they run. And then more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially alſo, it behoves us to receive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, when not only the people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, among whom we live, are given to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance; but when <hi>The leaders of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48912:31"/>
people alſo err through wine, and through ſtrong drink are out of the way:</hi> as, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 7, <hi>Then the leaders of the people cauſe them to err, and go aſtray alſo, and they that are led of them are deſtroyed,</hi> Iſa. 3. 12. and 9. 16. <hi>I have ſeen folly in the Prophets of Samaria,</hi> ſaith the Lord—<hi>They cauſed my people Iſrael to err. I have ſeen alſo in the Prophets of Jeruſalem</hi> (of the chief City) <hi>an horrible thing—They ſtrengthen the hands of evil-doers, that none doth return from his wickedneſs—Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts concerning the Prophets: Behold, I will feed them with worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and make them drink of the water of gall. For from the Prophets of Jeruſalem is profaneneneſs gone forth into all the land,</hi> Jer. 23. 13-15. When ſuch as theſe forſake the right way, and count it pleaſure to Riot in the day-time, then it is an evil time: Then many times <hi>they allure through the luſts of the fleſh—thoſe that were clean eſcaped from them that live in error,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 13-18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then alſo the Believers need to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of Intemperance when the dayes are ſinfully evil; Becauſe, when Rioting and Drunkenneſs are commonly practiſed, theſe evils may be committed without fear of ſhame and puniſhment: then <hi>there is none to put them to ſhame in any thing,</hi> as <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. 7. But they that tempt God, are even delivered from that ſhame and penalty which of right belongs to their tranſgreſſion, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14, 15.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48912:31"/>
The wicked walk on every ſide (openly and ſecurely, and do not hide themſelves) when Vileneſs (Rioting and Drunkenneſs) are exalted amongſt the Sons of men: And then it is high time for the righteous to cry, <hi>Save Lord, deliver us from our own, and others tranſgreſſions: Incline not our hearts to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work Iniquity, and let us not eat of their dainties,</hi> Pſalm 12. 1-8. and 141. 1-4, <hi>The rod and reproof give wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> But when perſons are left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, uſually they act and commit ſhameful things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 15. This was that which provoked the Lord to anger againſt <hi>Eli,</hi> who judged <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and might be ſome cauſe of his Sons great Impiety and Iniquity, and that they were ſuch children of <hi>Belial,</hi> that when they made themſelves vile he reſtrained them not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13. When Juſtice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are executed, and ſinners are ſhamed, and puniſhed according to the quality of their Offence, this puts an awe upon others, and cauſes them to take heed of Iniquity, leſt they alſo partake of the Puniſhment: And ſuch righteous Judges, and Magiſtrates, do put away evil from among the people: <hi>And all the people ſhall hear, and fear, and do ſo no more wickedly,</hi> or preſumptuouſly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 12, 13. and 13. 8-11. and 19. 18-21. And ſo it is ſaid particularly, <hi>When glutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us perſons and drunkards are puniſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48912:32"/>
intemperance, by this means the Judges put away evil from amongſt them: And all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhall hear and fear,</hi> Deut. 21. 20, 21. But, when we are all ſo naturally inclined to evil; and alſo every man is left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to do what is right in his own eyes, without check, ſhame, or puniſhment; when every man is a Law to himſelf, as it were, and the Reins are laid upon their Necks, that they may go whither they pleaſe: And when the Sons of the Mighty will not do Juſtice: when <hi>they know not, nor will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but walk on in darkneſs</hi> (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 1-5,) then it is high time to receive the admonition which the Holy Ghoſt is giving unto us, and to accept it thankfully from thoſe who are over us in the Lord, that they will admoniſh us of, and dehort us from this great and root-Iniquity of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: For then eſpecially we ſhall be ready to pollute our ſelves herewith, when we may do ſo, and not be reſtrained from it, or ſhamed, or puniſhed for it.</p>
            <p>Nay further, the Believers need to have and receive this admonition, when their Watch-men are poluted with Intemperance, or ſome of them: becauſe they that are ſo, cannot faithfully, or ſucceſsfully reprove ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an Iniquity of which they themſelves are alſo guilty. How canthey pluck out the Mote out of their Brothers eye, when he hold there is a Beam in their own? How can
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48912:32"/>
they fault, or with what face can they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Brethren for Inſobriety, when they alſo are given unto, and too often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with exceſs of <hi>Wine? Matth.</hi> 7. 3-5. Nay indeed, how can they reprove others of any evil whatſoever, while themſelves walk not with a right foot in the Goſpel, but eat and drink with the Drunken? Hence when the Apoſtle ſolemnly charges <hi>Timothy, Before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To preach the Word, and be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, reprove rebuke, exhort,</hi> &amp;c. He then inſtructs him: <hi>But watch thou, or be thou ſober, in all things</hi> (as the ſame word is read in ſome of our Margins, and ſo tranſlated elſewhere: as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.) As if he ſhould ſay, That thou mayeſt Preach the word faithfully, and Reprove and Rebuke Offenders, be thou thy ſelf Sober, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in all things, be not a partaker of other mens ſins, but keep thy ſelf pure; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe thou canſt not be a Reprover, or Faithful-reprover of others, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1-5. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. Alas, how do ſuch teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſtrengthen others in their evil wayes! their Brethren will ſay, ſurely Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and Intemperance are no great evils, for our leaders are Good-fellows alſo, and will joyn, and keep Company with us. And however we need not fear to be reproved by them; They dare not Propheſy unto us to cauſe us to take ſhame (as <hi>Micah</hi> 2. 6,)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48912:33"/>
becauſe they themſelves too often exceed in their Intemperance. Oh! needful therefore it is, for us to be dehorted from, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of this Iniquity, when men may ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of ſhame or puniſhment from the Civil Magiſtrate, and when alſo there are like People, like Prieſt: And now it's high time for us to ſuffer this word of admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exhortation; <hi>Be not drunk with Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Nay, when the dayes are ſo ſinfully evil, as hath been ſaid, we need then to have and receive this admonition here given to us; not only becauſe then we have more ſtrong temptations to Intemperance than at other times: nor only becauſe we may be guilty of it without ſhame, puniſhment, or reproof: But alſo in ſuch dayes we ſhall be reproached, frowned upon, and evilly dealt with; if we have not fellowſhip with them in their unfruitful works of darkneſs: others will think it ſtrange if we run not with them to the ſame exceſs of Riot, Blaſpheming and ſpeaking evil of us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3, 4. So it was in evil dayes in <hi>Iſrael: Judgment was turned backward, and Juſtice ſtood afar off: for truth was fallen in the ſtreets, and equity could not enter: Yea truth failed, and he that departed from evil made himſelf a prey;</hi> or was counted a Mad-man, a Fanatick, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 14, 15. So now too many hate the good, and love the evil, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 1-3. And hereby think
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48912:33"/>
to affright men, and ſcare them into their evil wayes and manners, by their reproaches, frowns, ſcoffs, deriſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then it is an evil time indeed, a ſinful and perilous time, when the juſt are afflicted, becauſe they will not put forth their hand to Iniquity with others, but refrain their feet from their evil wayes and crooked paths, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 10-13. And then eſpecially they need to be admoniſhed to flee Inſobriety, when they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, vilified, and perſecuted by others for ſo doing, leſt by the evil uſe they meet with, they be corrupted from the right way, and turn aſide after Satan.</p>
            <p>Nay, when the dayes are ſinfully evil, then the way to meet with praiſe from others, preferment, and ſafety, is to do as the moſt of men do, and to walk in the broad way with them: then the vileſt of the Sons of men are exalted, even ſuch as walk in riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes and practiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 8. Then <hi>the proud are counted happy, and they that work wickedneſs are ſet up, and they that tempt God are even delivered,</hi> Mal. 3. 13-15. And therefore in ſuch dayes eſpecially we need to be admoniſhed to abſtain from every kind of evil whatſoever, and particularly from this of Intemperance: for we love naturally to be well ſpoken of by others, and to be advanced or lifted up amongſt men, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to enjoy our liberty, and be ſecured from all reproach, and moleſtation from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48912:34"/>
and therefore when all outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, promotion, and protection are aſſured unto, and injoyed by ſuch as will eat, drink, and be drunken: How ready are we by occaſion hereof, to wander out of the way of underſtanding, and to have fellowſhip with them in their unfruitful works of darkneſs? The world will love its own, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>They that forſake the Law, praiſe the wicked,</hi> Prov. 28. 4. The world cannot hate them that are of it, and who do fulfil its luſts, but delights in them, and think, theſe are the only perſons that are meet to be confided in; and that will be truſty, and faithful, in any truſt that is committed to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 7. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe are the perſons that ſhall be countenanced, promoted, protected, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and be the men, the darlings and dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the times: Theſe are they that ſhall be accounted honeſt men, and good-fellows, ſuch as will be true to their friends: theſe are the men that ſhall be reputed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be bountiful and liberal perſons, (though in truth they are Churls and vile ones in the eſteem and account of him that judgeth righteouſly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 5-8.) And who ſo meet for ſociety, countenance, ſecurity, and advance ment, as theſe? Oh therefore! what great need have we when the dayes are evil, to be admoniſhed and warned to flee from this path of the deſtroyer, even from Intemperance,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48912:34"/>
and to receive, and obey the admonition given unto us, and to that end to go forth unto Chriſt without the Camp, bearing his reproach, who was ſpoken againſt by them that ſate in the Gate, even by the Judges, and Magiſtrates, and was the ſong of the Drunkards, or, of the Drinkers of <hi>Strong Drimk, Heb.</hi> 13. 13. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 12.</p>
            <p>Oh then, when the dayes are evil, ſuffer this word of exhortation which is here given to you by the Holy Ghoſt: And as ye are Children of light, walk as ſuch: let diſcretion preſerve you, and underſtanding keep you from thoſe crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wayes and evil paths; and that you walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous: And to move hereto, let us briefly conſider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It hath been the practice of good men in evil times, inſtead of complying with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones, or having any fellowſhip with them in their unfruitful works of darkneſs, to be filled with grief and ſorrow, not only for their own evils; but for the miſcarriages of others alſo. <hi>The righteous Soul of juſt Lot was vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8. Rivers of waters run down the eyes of the ſweet Pſalmiſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe men kept not Gods Law: he beheld the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors and was grieved, becauſe they kept not Gods word, <hi>Plal.</hi> 119. 136, 158.

They did mourn and weep for the abominations that were committed in the midſt of them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. Yea, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe they knew not the time of their viſitation, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41, 42. And the Apoſtle feared he ſhould have cauſe when he came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to bewail many which had ſinned, and had not repented of the Uncleanneſs, Fornication, and Laſciviouſneſs which they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20, 21. They were ſo far from oyning with evil doers then, as that they were full of heavineſs, and expreſt it outwardly in weeping and ſighing for the many abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions done by them amongſt whom they lived. Walk we alſo in the way of thoſe good men, and be we diligent followers of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In walking honeſtly according to the teachings of the Grace of God, we may be Inſtruments of mercy and good to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom we live; Both in cauſing them to conſider their wayes, and to return from their wickedneſs, unto him againſt whom they have ſinned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 14, 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1.

day, the day of deſolation haſtened upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 16. and 18. 20. God had ſpared <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha, &amp;c.</hi> And had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thoſe Cities, had there been ten righteous perſons found therein, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 32; and though there were not, yet he accepted <hi>Lot</hi> who interceded for <hi>Zoar,</hi> and did not overthrow it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 19-22. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that very ſmall remnant of upright ones that were leſt in <hi>Judah,</hi> therefore that nation was not made as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and like to <hi>Gomorrha, Iſa.</hi> 1. 7-9. So when Chriſt threatens, that if the Angel and Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> did not watch, he would come on them as a thief, and they ſhould not know what hour he would come upon them: He adds; <hi>But</hi> (as ſome read) <hi>thou haſt a few names even in Sardis, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I have reſpect to them, and therefore will not ſo ſuddenly haſten the execution of what I threaten upon thee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's highly acceptable unto God, and approvable in his ſight, that in evil times they keep themſelves unſpotted from the world, and defile not their garments, as the generality do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 4. And he takes ſpecial notice of them, and grants ſignal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to them: And though they, all that will live godly in Chriſt, ſhall ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet in his deſolating-judgments he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doth diſcriminate them from others, who have in evil times walked before him,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48912:36"/>
and been perfect. So <hi>Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord, He being a juſt man and perfect in his generations: And Noah walked with God, when the earth was corrupt before God: And the earth was filled with violence for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the earth—And the Lord ſaid unto Noah, Come thou and all thy houſe</hi> (it fared the better for him) <hi>into the Ark; for thee have I ſeen righteous before me,</hi> Gen. 6. 7, 8-12-22. and 7. 1. 2 Pet. 2. 5. <hi>And when he turned the Cities of Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha into aſhes—He delivered just Lot vexed with the filthy converſation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: And the Lord ſtill knoweth how to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the godly out of temptation,</hi> Gen. 19. 2. 2 Pet. 2. 6-9. ſee alſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 3, 4. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 24, 30, 38. And when he threatned to executed deſolating-Judgments upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet before the execution thereof, <hi>The Lord ſaid to the man cloathed with linnen, which had the writers Inkhorn by his ſide; Go thorow the midſt of the city—and ſet a mark on the foreheads of them that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that were done in the midſt thereof. And to the others, which had every man a ſlaughter-weapon in his hand,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Go ye—thorow the city and ſmite, let not your eye ſpare, neither have ye pity: ſlay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: But come not near any upon whom is the mark: And begin at my

ſanctuary,</hi> thoſe that come neareſt to me, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 2-4-6-11. and 14. 14, 16, 18, 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 2, 3. And though the iniquity of any Nation, upon whom his name is called, be ſo great, as that he is reſolved to give it up into the hand of ſtrangers, and to deal with it, as he ſaid he would do, and did with <hi>Iſrael; Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, I am againſt thee, and will draw forth my ſword out of his ſheath, and will cut off</hi> (not from the earth, but) <hi>from thee the righteous and the wicked,</hi> Ezek. 21. 3, 4. Yet, though thoſe who have kept themſelves unſpotted from the Pollutions of the World, have their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and treaſures ſpoiled by the enemy, and are not wholly hid, he may cauſe the enemy to entreat them well in the time of evil, and in the time of affliction, and give them their lives for a prey, and cauſe them to be pitied of them that lead them captives, as he did to <hi>Jeremy, Baruch, Ebedmelech, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 11-14. and 39. 17, 18. and 40. 2-4. and 45. 5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 9: yea, he by way of promiſe ſaith; He will ſpare them, who exercſe themſelves to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, when others of their brethren pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly grow prophane, wicked, and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, <hi>as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him,</hi> Mal. 3. 13-16, 17. And to ſuch he hath a peculiar reſpect, and will cauſe them to come nigher to him than others ſhall do; though in their returning from their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48912:37"/>
he forgive them, and receive them graciouſly: <hi>The Prieſts, the Levites—that kept the charge of my ſanctuary, when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael went aſtray from me, they ſhall come near to me, to miniſter unto me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 44. 10-13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Thou haſt a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments, ſaith the Lord Jeſus: And they ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi> Rev. 3. 4: the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of all which might ingage us. <hi>To come out from among men in evil days, and be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and touch no unclean thing:</hi> And the Lord Almighty will receive us (whoever reject us) and will be a Father to us, and we ſhall be to him for ſons and daughters. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes and encouragements, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14-17, 18. and 7. 1. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. As evil ſignifies evil of Affliction and Judgment; ſo we may receive this further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: That when the days are evil, when God's Judgments are poured forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and felt by us, and greater fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then eſpecially we need to have, and receive this Admonition, that we <hi>be not drunk with Wine,</hi> but that we watch againſt all intemperance and inſobriety: <hi>When thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in the earth,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>the inhabitants of the world will learn righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Iſa. 26. 9. And therefore then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48912:37"/>
the Believers eſpecially to be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all things: So it was with <hi>Daniel</hi> and his three companions when they were in captivity, and under great affliction: they would not defile themſelves with the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King's meat, nor with the Wine which he drank, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 5-8-16. And indeed, as it is always ſinful, ſo it is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable to eat and drink to exceſs, when God is caſting us down in his Providences, and ordering occaſions of mourning, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to us: when men are <hi>miniſhed and brought low thorow oppreſſion, affliction, and ſorrow,</hi> Pſal. 107. 39. When we ſee <hi>a ſword, a ſword is ſharpened, and alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhed: it is ſharpened to make a ſore ſlaughter; it is furbiſhed that it ſhould glitter; ſhould we then make mirth?</hi> Ezek. 21. 9, 10. ſhould we unfit our ſelves for a wiſe conſideration of the Lord's doings, when he is making deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations amongſt us? ſurely this will be an high aggravation of our iniquity, as is once and again ſignified to us: <hi>Wo unto them, ſaith the Lord, that riſe up early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they may follow ſtrong drink, that continue until night, till Wine inflame them: And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feaſts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, nor the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hands,</hi> Iſa. 5. 11, 12. <hi>In that day did the Lord God of hoſts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldneſs, and to

girding with ſack-cloath: And behold, joy and gladneſs, ſlaying oxen, and killing ſheep, eating fleſh, and drinking wine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in mine ears by the Lord of hoſts, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you till ye dye, ſaith the Lord God of hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 22. 1-12-14. <hi>Wo to them that put far away the evil day—that lye upon beds of ivory, and ſtretch themſelves upon their couches, or abound with ſuperfluity; and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midſt of the ſtall. That chaunt, or quaver to the ſound of the viol:—That drink Wine in bowles, and anoint themſelves with the chief oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But they are not grieved for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Joſeph. Therefore now ſhall they go captive with the firſt that go captive, and the banquet of them that ſtretched themſelves ſhall be removed,</hi> Amos 6. 1-3-6-8.

And ſuch have been, and are the times in which we live: wherein God hath been ſharpening his ſword, and hath made great ſlaughters amongſt us in former times: And as yet, it is not put up into it's Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard.

            <p n="1">1. In the Goſpel is ſhewn unto us, that we have a comfortable injoyment of our lives, and of all our Meat and Drink, vouchſafed to us through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt; we were all dead, ſenſually dead, condemned to dye, as the Apoſtle ſignifieth to us when he ſaith, <hi>If one died for all,</hi> in the room and ſtead of all, <hi>then were all dead:</hi> And upon the account of, and by vertue of ones dying for all, and riſing again, dead men now live in their ſeveral ages and generations, <hi>to the end they might not live to themſelves, or the luſts of men, but to him which died for them, and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. 1 Pet. 4. 1-3. <hi>He partook with us of fleſh and blood, that he might through death deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil: And deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> Heb. 2. 14, 15. God had threatned, that in the day man did eat of the forbidden fruit, in dying, he ſhould dye: And by our firſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48912:42"/>
Fathers diſobedience we fell under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death: And though we might have had a ſenſible being, yet it had heen a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable one; we could have had no comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able being in this world: But now, when Chriſt was interpoſed, and God promiſed this Seed of the Woman; <hi>Adam</hi> in belief of God's promiſe, of his purpoſe and grace, gives his Wife a new name, and called her <hi>Eve,</hi> or <hi>Chavah, becauſe ſhe was the mother of all living,</hi> who otherwiſe had been the mother of all dead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17, with <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 15-20. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son into the world, that we might live through him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 9.

And hence we are inſtructed <hi>to give thanks alwayes for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Eph. 5. 20. To ſignify to us, that all the mercies we are made partakers of, we partake of them upon the account of the Sufferings, Sacrifice, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and all mixtures of mercy and compaſſion in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and deliverance therefrom, is, becauſe God hath found out a ranſom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 3-8. <hi>Job</hi> 33. 19-24. And the end of all his goodneſs extended and continued to us through our bleſſed Mediator, is, <hi>to lead us to repentance, Rom.</hi> 2. 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. And ſurely, were this heartily minded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that our lives, and our comfortable enjoyment of Gods mercies, are the price of his Blood and Sacrifice, and vouchſaſed to us <hi>that we might live, not to the luſts of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48912:43"/>
men, but to the will of God:</hi> it would be powerful to preſerve us from conſuming upon our luſts the good things we receive at ſo dear a rate. Hence the Apoſtle when he exhorts the Believers <hi>to walk honeſtly—not in rioting and drunkenneſs;</hi> he to this end inſtructs them <hi>to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 13. 13, 14; and counſels them <hi>to walk in the Spirit, whoſe work it is to glorify Chriſt, and receive of his things, and ſhew unto us:</hi> and ſaith he, <hi>Ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh: Amongſt which are revellings and drunkenneſs,</hi> Gal. 5. 16-18-21. And from the conſideration hereof, that <hi>the earth is the Lords,</hi> even the Lord Jeſus Chriſts, <hi>and the fulneſs thereof:</hi> and that <hi>by grace we are made partakers of a comfortable enjoyment of Gods mercies,</hi> even by the grace of our Lord Jeſus, who ſo greatly humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for our ſakes: And by the grace of God, whereby Jeſus Chriſt taſted death for every man: The Apoſtle exhorteth the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that <hi>whether they eat, or drink, or whatſoever they did, they ſhould do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 21, 26-28-31. And the not conſidering, or taking notice of this, is the reaſon and cauſe of mens abuſe of the good creatures of God, and of their conſuming them upon their luſts, or in the ſervice of their Idols. Hence the Lord ſaith, <hi>the did not know, or take notice, that I gave
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48912:43"/>
her Corn, and Wine, and Oyl—which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Baal,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 6-8. Did we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed conſider at what a dear rate we have all the mercies vouchſafed to us, it would powerfully help us, thus to ſay, Seeing theſe are the price of the Blood of my bleſſed Redeemer, ſhall I abuſe and waſte that which coſt ſo dear? <hi>Shall I tread under my feet the precious Blood of Chriſt? God forbid. How ſhall I do ſuch wickedneſs and ſin againſt the precious Blood, and powerful mediation of my Lord, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> and affords me theſe conforts and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>that I might live to him that died for me, and roſe again?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1-3.</p>
            <p>Yea indeed, now, the greatneſs, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the wonderfulneſs of the grace of God, are more brightly manifeſted and clearly diſcovered to us, than they were in former times; and thereby greater obligation is laid upon us now, than upon others under the more dark miniſtration of the Law, to flee from the ſervice of our Luſts and Idols. <hi>Through the tender mercy of our God, the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us, To give light to them that ſate in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide our feet into the way of peace,</hi> Luk. 1. 78, 79. Jeſus Chriſt is now evidently ſet forth before our eyes, as one
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48912:44"/>
who hath been Crucified for us, in which the vileneſs and odiouſneſs of our ſins and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is clearly diſcovered to us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. The Goſpel is preached according to the Revelation of the myſtery; and the grace of God hath been more clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed than before Chriſts coming in the fleſh; yea, than before he had poured down, and ſhed forth the Holy Spirit upon his Apoſtles from Heaven, after he aſcended on high: Therefore now eſpecially it behoves us, and we are more powerfully enabled and moved to flee from all Intemperance, and the evil fruits thereof. <hi>The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand, let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſs, and put on the armour of light; let us walk honeſtly as in the day-time; not in rioting and drunkenneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Now it is high time for us to awake out of Sleep: for now <hi>all things that are reproved, are made manifeſt by the light,</hi> Rom. 13. 11-14. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13-18 <hi>They that ſleep, ſleep in the night, and they that are drunken are drunken in the night: But let us who are of the day, be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber—For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus, who died for us, that whether we wake or ſleep we ſhould live together with him,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 4-8-10. <hi>The grace of God which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation to all men, hath appeared: Teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48912:44"/>
worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, &amp;c.</hi> Tit. 2. 10-12. <hi>The true light now ſhineth—love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, not the luſt of the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 8 15, 16. <hi>At the times of mens igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance God winketh at them,</hi> Act. 17. 30. But now mens ſins will be greatly aggravated, if they count it a pleaſure to riot in the day time, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. Surely it will be more tolerable in the day of judgment for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> than for ſuch as now walk on in preferring darkneſs before light.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Goſpel of Chriſt the holy Spirit is diſcovering to us infinitely better things prepared for us in Chriſt, than any of thoſe things in the abuſe whereof we are vainly ſeeking comfort and contentment to our Souls: Therein is diſcovered to us, that by means of the precious blood of Chriſt, all things are now actually prepared, and made ready for us: The holy Spirit is lifting up Chriſt as an object in whom there are all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things provided for mankind: A feaſt of fat things for all people, <hi>of Wines on the Lees,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That we might look unto him, and be ſaved from our ſins, and from the vanity of our converſations,</hi> Luk. 14. 17. Gen. 22. 18. Eph. 1. 3. Iſa. 25. 6. and 45. 22. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. And that we might labour for, and ſeek after, not that meat which periſheth, <hi>but this which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

And in hearkening diligently unto, and coming to him, <hi>we may eat that which is good, and our ſouls may delight themſelves in fatneſs,</hi> Iſa. 55 1-3, <hi>we may rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory,</hi> in the worſt of days and times, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6-8. Alas, men do propoſe a great deal of ſatisfaction and contentment to themſelves in the abuſe of God's mercies: they think that is the way for them to lead merry and comfortable lives, and to ſpend their days in gladneſs and jollity: that this is the way to be delivered from all melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, and evil and afflictive ſadneſs: And eſpecially in evil times, in days of affliction and mourning, they ſuppoſe the only way then to drive away ſorrow from their hearts, is, to <hi>pour in Wine and ſtrong Drink, till Wine inflame them:</hi> when as in ſuch a time, the Lord is then calling to weeping, and to mourning: And therefore, <hi>ſorrow is better then laughter, for by the ſadneſs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the heart is made better. The heart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning: But the heart of fools is in the houſe of mirth,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 1-5-14. And beſides, men do but deceive themſelves in promiſing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any ſolid or durable joy and comfort from their exceſſive partaking of <hi>Wine and ſtrong Drink,</hi> or eating any dainty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious

And therefore ſuch perſons do but deceive themſelves, and are deceived by <hi>Wine, for Wine is a mocker, ſtrong Drink is raging: and whoſoever is deceived thereby, is not wiſe,</hi> Prov. 20. 1. The holy Ghoſt ſaith not, who hath a merry heart, and cheerful ſpirit? who hath ſolid and ſubſtantial joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48912:46"/>
ſo abuſe and diſtemper themſelves, will bite like a Serpent, and ſting like an Adder: this they ſhall receive from God's hand, they ſhall lye down in ſorrow, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 29-32. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10, 11. For God giveth to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to him that wanders out of the way of underſtanding, travel and grief, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 26. But now in Jeſus Chriſt God hath prepared for us, and in the Goſpel the holy Spirit is diſcovering to us, that which is proper to comfort and rejoyce the hearts of all that mourn: here is a Cup of conſolation, which being Drunk in by us, will comfort us in all our tribulations and ſadneſſes, and make the heart truly and laſtingly, yea everlaſtingly merry: And <hi>though all the days of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted are evil; yet he that hath a merry heart hath a continual feaſt,</hi> Prov. 15. 14, 15, ſuch an one is filled with joy and peace, in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>and a ſtranger doth not intermeddle with his joy,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. Prov. 14. 10. And though in evil days, outward occaſions of ſorrow are preſented and adminiſtred to him; and <hi>his belly trembles, his lips quiver, and rottenneſs enters into his bones:</hi> And all ſeen comforts and delight are removed and taken away: Although <hi>the figtree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines</hi> (and ſo the Drunkards weep, and Drinkers of <hi>Wine and ſtrong Drink</hi> howl, <hi>Joel</hi> 1. 5.); yet they may and ſhall <hi>rejoyce in the Lord, and joy

in the God of their ſalvation,</hi> Habbak. 3. 16-18. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2-4. When God's judgments are ſo in the earth, as that <hi>the new Wine mourneth, the vine languiſheth, all the merry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted do ſigh: the mirth of tabrets ceaſeth, the noiſe of them that rejoyce endeth; the joy of the harp ceaſeth: they ſhall not drink Wine with a ſong, ſtrong drink ſhall be bitter to them that drink it—When thus it ſhall be in the midſt of the land among the people, even then the righteous, who are ſeeking the Lord,</hi> and ſeeking his face and his ſtrength, ſuch as have their dwelling in Heaven, <hi>they ſhall lift up their voice, they ſhall ſing for the majeſty of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 7-16. <hi>Oh bleſſed are the poople that know the joyful ſound,</hi> come what times will come, <hi>they ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance. In thy name ſhall they rejoyce all the day; and in thy righteouſneſs ſhall they be exalted</hi> (to honour and ſafety), <hi>For thou art the glory of their ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 89. 15-17. In Chriſt, to whom the holy Spirit is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, we may rejoyce always, even in the time of greateſt affliction and ſadneſs alſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 1. and 4. 4. His <hi>blood is drink indeed,</hi> this will cheer, revive, and refreſh the very heart and ſpirit of the drinker: And his love therein commended, is better, infinitely better than Wine, and more to be deſired, and rather to be choſen than ſtrong Drink.

               <hi>And who ſo eateth his fleſh, and drinketh his blood, hath everlaſting life, and he will raiſe him up at the laſt day,</hi> Joh. 6. 54-57. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2-4. and 2. 3-5. Oh therefore in evil dayes and times, when ſorrow and ſadneſs is adminiſtred to you; and how many Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Provocations from others ſoever you meet withal; <hi>yet be not drunk with Wine—But be ye filled with the ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 16-18, 19, Forſake not the Lord, the fountain of living waters, to hew to your ſelves ciſterns, broken ciſterns that can hold no water: But <hi>if any man thirſt, let him come unto Chriſt and drink: And whoſoever drinketh of this water of life that he will give him that cometh unto him, ſhall never thirſt; but the water that he will give him ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> Jer. 2. 13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37, 38. and 4. 10-14. And <hi>when ſhame ſhall be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of fools: when the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim ſhall be trodden under foot—In that day ſhall the Lord of hoſts be for a crown of glory, and for a Diadem of beauty to the reſidue of his people,</hi> who in the light and ſtrength of his grace, denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts, have lived ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And come unto Chriſt as the reſt for their weary Spirits, and unto him as the refreſhing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 1-3-5-12. Oh then! that we may not ſpend our money and time

for that which is not bread, nor labour for that which ſatisfieth not; let us hearken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently unto Chriſt in his Goſpel, and eat that which is good, and let our Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themſelves in fatneſs: <hi>Let us go into the houſe of the Lord, and eat of Wiſdom's bread, and drink of the Wine which ſhe hath mingled; let us forſake the fooliſh,</hi> the drunken Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, <hi>and live, and go in the way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> Inſtead of laviſhing our money out of the bag for ſtrong Drink, let us buy the truth, and not ſell it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1-3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 1-6. and 23. 20-23. Is it becauſe there is no comfort, peace, ſatsfaction, joy, and contentment in Chriſt, that we walk in rioting and drunkenneſs? What iniquity is there, or have we found in him, that we ſhould turn our backs upon, and forſake him, and make our bellies our God? Hath he been, or is he a barren Wilderneſs, or a dry Tree, that we ſcatter our ways unto ſtrangers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Service of our vile and brutiſh affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before him, in whom dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the God-head bodily; and in whom is all compleatneſs prepared for us? ſurely no: Oh then!

Be we then temperate in all things, and let us flee from all inſobriety, that we may enjoy <hi>that Crown of life which the Lord hath promiſed to them that wait for, and love him.</hi> Conſidering alſo,</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <hi>That Drunkards ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God; for without are dogs,</hi> whereto Drunkards are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and which name is given to them, becauſe <hi>their tables are full of vomit and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, ſo that there is no place clean,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 10. 2 Pet. 2. 13-22. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10, 11. and 28. 8. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14, 15. But to this we have ſpoken ſomewhat before, and therefore ſhall not further enlarge to it.</p>
            <p>Yea, and now alſo it is the laſt time, and therefore it behoves us <hi>to walk honeſtly as in the day-time, not in rioting and drunkenneſs: The end of all things is at hand, be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſober, and watch unto prayer,</hi> ſaith 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Little Children, young men, Fathers, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world; love not the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48912:51"/>
Pamper not the fleſh now eſpecially; glut not your ſelves with the good things here below; now <hi>the world paſſeth away, and the luſts thereof; little children, it is the laſt time,</hi> or hour, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 12-15, 16-18. <hi>And you may perfectly know that the day of the Lord ſo cometh as a thief in the night: Therefore ſleep not as do others, but watch and be ſober,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 2-6. Remember what our Saviour hath foretold, and ſpoken for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come. <hi>As it was in the dayes of Noah, ſo ſhall it be alſo in the dayes of the Son of man: they did eat, they drank,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>untill the day that Noah entered into the Ark, and the Flood came and deſtroyed them all. Likewiſe alſo, as it was in the dayes of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the ſame day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone from Heaven, and deſtroyed them all: Even thus ſhall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed,</hi> Luk. 17. 26-30. Oh! be not then drunk with wine, leſt that day, or the day of death, come upon us unawares: <hi>for as a ſnare ſhall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth: watch we therefore, and pray alwayes, that we may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of man:</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48912:51"/>
his Diſciples. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34-36. And what we have ſpoken, ſhall ſuffice to the firſt thing we propounded to conſider and ſpeak unto: Namely, the dehortation, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition which the Apoſtle gives unto theſe Believers, and at ſuch a time. And now we come to ſpeak unto the ſecond thing propounded to be further conſidered by us from this verſe we are ſpeaking unto; Namely,</p>
            <p>[2] We have an Argument, or motive laid down by the Apoſtle, to engage the Believers, that they ſhould not be Drunk with <hi>Wine, viz. [Wherein is exceſs.]</hi> And ſurely did we underſtand what is contained herein, it would be powerful to engage us to receive and obey the admonition which is here given to us by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Now we may underſtand theſe words, either as an account of what the Apoſtle, means and intends by the <hi>Wine</hi> wherewith he would not have us be Drunk, or filled; namely, that <hi>wherein is exceſs:</hi> in the uſe, or abuſe whereof men may exceed the bounds of Sobriety: And then he doth intimate to us, that there are <hi>Wines</hi> and <hi>Dainties</hi> whereof we may drink, and drink abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wherewith we may be filled, and yet there is no exceſs in ſo doing: But the more we drink, the more welcom and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable we are to God, and profitable to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48912:52"/>
men; and this bleſſedneſs they ſhall partake of, who from the wonderful preciouſneſs, and <hi>admirable excellency of Gods loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Children of men, do put their truſt under the ſhadow of his wings; ſuch ſhall be</hi> inebriated, or, <hi>plentifully ſilled, and ſatisfied with the fatneſs of his houſe, with whom is the Fountain of Life,</hi> Pſal. 36. 7-9. But to this we ſhall have more apt occaſion to ſpeak in the Exhortation following. <hi>[But be ye filled with the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or alſo, we may look upon theſe words <hi>[Wherein is exceſs],</hi> as an argument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Believers, <hi>not to be drunk with wine;</hi> and ſo to flee from all, and all manner of Inſobriety: and ſo we deſire to ſpeak to them: And ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>[Exceſs]</hi> is not only meant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance in eating and drinking; for of that he had warned them before, in ſaying, <hi>Be not drunk:</hi> and to which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But alſo by <hi>[Exceſs]</hi> is meant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, and waſtfully ſpending this worlds good which God is putting into our hands, that we might honour and glorify him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 9, 10. So the Prodigal did prodigally and profuſely waſte his ſubſtance with this Intemperance amongſt other things, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 12, 13. And we may ſee by experience, that ordinarily in Drunkenneſs is ſuch exceſs, an exceſſive ſpending and conſuming mens eſtates
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48912:52"/>
and riches, and impoveriſhing themſelves thereby, and directly bringing themſelves, and alſo provoking God to bring them to penury and beggary: <hi>He that loveth Wine and Oyl, ſhall not be rich,</hi> Prov. 21. 17; from this evil concomitant and conſequent of Drunkenneſs, the Holy Ghoſt gives us this admonition: <hi>Hear thou, my Son, and be wiſe, and guide thine heart in the way: Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Wine-bibbers, amongſt riotous eaters of fleſh: For the Drun ard and the Glutton ſhall come to poverty, and drowſineſs ſhall cloathe him with raggs,</hi> Prov. 23. 10-21. <hi>He that followeth after vain perſons, ſhall have poverty enough,</hi> Prov. 28. 19. Men do laviſh Gold out of the Bag for the ſatisfying this brutiſh and ſwiniſh affection and luſt: yea, and by their Intemperance they unfit themſelves for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in buſineſs, and diſpoſe themſelves to ſleepineſs, drowſineſs, and ſlothfulneſs, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 6, 7; <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 21: And hereby alſo they bring want and poverty upon themſelves. <hi>I went by the field of the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful—And lo it was all grown over with thorns.—Then I ſaw and conſidered it well, I looked upon it, and received inſtruction. Yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep; ſo ſhall thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man,</hi> Prov. 24. 30-34. and 6. 6-9-11. And by their Drunkenneſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48912:53"/>
and Intemperance, and the want which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows thereupon, they do uſually bring upon themſelves, and load themſelves with many diſtracting and diſtreſſing cares, how they ſhall be provided for, and their Families; or how they ſhall pay and diſcharge their debts, and keep themſelve out of Priſon: or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly how they ſhall have enough continued to them to conſume upon their luſts for the future. Hence our Saviour puts the cares of this world as the conſequent of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your heart be overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life,</hi> Luk. 21. 34. And this exceſs which is in Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, is a great evil, and the cauſe of very many evils alſo, ſome of which have beeen intimated before.</p>
            <p>As, Hereby men unfit themſelves for the end for which they are betruſted with this Worlds good, which is, to do good therewith to others alſo: For whatſoever intereſt men have in the things of this world, or right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them; yet they are owners of them, not as abſolute Lords, but as accountable Stewards, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 1-8; and muſt give an account to the great and ſupream Lord in due ſeaſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9-12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. Now when men conſume theſe goods upon the ſervice of their luſts, many times their own Families, if they have any, their Wives
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48912:53"/>
and Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be in great want: <hi>And he that provideth not for his own, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for thoſe of his own houſehold, he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 6-8. Or, if they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, there are many poor creatures of mankind, for whom Chriſt died, who are in great wants, and ſtraits, and deſtitute of daily food: And what God hath put into our hands, and commited to us, is, to take our own portion out of it, and to do good to others with the reſidue, who ſtand in need. And ſo they are called, and are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans; even given to us for refreſhing the Bowels of others, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 12. And we are inſtructed, <hi>not to withhold good from them to whom it is due, or from the owners thereof, when it is in the power of our hand to do it,</hi> Prov. 3. 27, 28. But now when men are given to <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> and ſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, they put themſelves out of capacity to adminiſter to others to whom it is due, by the inſtructions of their Lord, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might do. <hi>This was the iniquity of Sodom, pride and fulneſs of bread; and</hi> as the conſequent, and concomitant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>abundance of idleneſs; neither did ſhe ſtregthen the hand of the poor and needy,</hi> Ezek. 16. 49. Indeed this Drunkenneſs and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpending, both take away the heart, and hinder men from pitying others; and alſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48912:54"/>
diſable them, ſo as it is not in the power of their hand to do good, as otherwiſe it might be.</p>
            <p>And again, when men through their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance are prodigal and proſuſe, many times at laſt it ſo impoveriſhes them, as that they fall into ſome other bad courſe and practice for providing for themſelves, or for their luſts: As, by their poverty they are led to deſraud and over-reach others; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more groſly to ſteal from others: <hi>Agur</hi> prayed God <hi>to feed him with bread convenient; leſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I be poor and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain,</hi> Prov. 30. 9.</p>
            <p>However, it makes men greedy of filthy lucre, that they might ſtill have wherewith to riot, and ſpend upon their luſts. As the Lord ſaith of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Watch-men in former times: <hi>they are all greedy dogs, which can never have enough, which know not to be ſatisfied—they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter: Come ye, ſay they, I will fotch Wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink; and tomorrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant,</hi> Iſa. 56. 11, 12. ſo it is ſaid of the King of <hi>Babylon. Becauſe he tranſgreſſeth by wine—he keepeth not at home, who inlargeth his deſire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be ſatisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people.</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:48912:54"/>
Where <hi>[his tranſgreſſing by Wine]</hi> is laid down as the cauſe of all his greedy and inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable deſire after the inlarging his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as one that could never have enough, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 5. yea, many are the evil fruits of this Drunkenneſs, and of that exceſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality which is in it. As ſometimes when perſons have ſpent all, and reflect, and look back again upon it, it fills them with an heap of grief, and deſperate ſorrow, even with <hi>worldly ſorrow,</hi> which <hi>worketh death,</hi> Ezek. 23. 33. ſometimes their exceſs leads them to bear falſe witneſs againſt others, or to kill and murder them in ſecret, if they may but advantage themſelves thereby, and get more ſewel to conſume upon the fire of this brutiſh, and vile affection and luſt of intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>And indeed, that there is ſuch exceſs in Drunkenneſs, namely, a profuſe and prodigal ſpending of ones eſtate, and that alſo leads to many other evils, as is in part ſhewn: The conſideration of it might move us to flee from inſobriery, as from the face of a Serpent. Alas, what account will men give of their ſtewardſhip, when they appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord? If the unprofitable Servant, who hid his Lord's talent in the earth, and when his Lord came to reckon with him, returned back to his Lord that which was his, muſt be caſt into
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48912:55"/>
outer darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, Becauſe he had not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it; how can ſuch eſcape the wrath to come, who conſume their Lord's goods upon their luſts? How altogether unaccountable will their prodigality and waſtfulneſs appear to be, when God ſhall render to every one according to his deeds! <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 24-30. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 48-51. Then will he ſay to the unprofitable ones, and much rather to thoſe great Waſters who continue ſuch, and are not waſhed from this Iniquity in the blood of the lamb: <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat, I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink,</hi> &amp;c. Which account of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Judgment is immediately ſubjoyned to that of the unprofitable Servant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 30-42, <hi>He ſhall then have judgment without mercy, who ſhewed no mercy,</hi> but waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away all that ſubſtance which his Lord committed to him, and remembred not to ſhew mercy to the poor and needy, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 14-16. Remember what was the portion of the rich man, who lived like an Epicure; and which parable is preſently added after that concerning the ſteward who had waſted his Lord's goods: <hi>He fared ſumptuouſly every day, and remembred not to ſhew mercy to poor Lazarus:</hi> And at laſt, the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48912:55"/>
place of torment was his portion, in which he could not obtain a drop of Water to cool his tongue, who had ſwallowed and devoured ſo much Wine and ſtrong Drink in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 1-19-25. <hi>Oh conſider this now, yet that forget God,</hi> that you may not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Drunkenneſs in which is exceſs, <hi>leſt hereafter he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In which is <hi>[Exceſs]:</hi> namely, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe waſting and miſpending our precious time which God is graciouſly giving and continuing unto us, to the end we might <hi>ſeek after the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near at hand.</hi> In verſe 16, of this Chapter, the Apoſtle had exhorted theſe believers <hi>to walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—redeeming the time,</hi> or opportunity: now as oppoſed to redeeming the time, he warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Drunkenneſs, ſaith, <hi>therein is exceſs,</hi> a waſteful conſuming and miſpending, or ſelling away our time upon, and for the Service of our luſts: And this ſhould powerfully move and ingage us to receive the Admonition here given unto us, <hi>not to be drunk with Wine:</hi> certainly had not Chriſt been made fleſh for us, had he not been made a partaker of fleſh and blood, and died for us, <hi>and through death deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil:</hi> we muſt neceſſarily have been <hi>all our life-time ſubject to the bondage of the Devil,</hi> and muſt have done <hi>and fulfilled his luſts</hi> and requirings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48912:56"/>
17. But to the end that his ſnare might be broken, and we delivered, therefore our Lord Jeſus by the grace of God taſteth death for every man: And hath procured a comfortable life-time for us here: But to what end, ſuppoſe we, hath he ſo done? Is it that we ſhould return to our former bondage? no certainly; for then he needed not to have been ſo greatly abaſed, and ſo to have humbled himſelf, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us therefrom. But therefore he died for us, and roſe again, and continues through his mediation a life-time to us; that after his grace brings Salvation to us, <hi>we ſhould no longer live</hi> the reſt of our time <hi>in the fleſh, to the luſts of men, but to the will of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 2, 3. where it plainly appears, the <hi>luſts of men,</hi> our own or others, and the <hi>will of God,</hi> are oppoſed the one to the other. Thoſe that live to the former, cannot live to the latter. Though to every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 1-11, yet it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of God, that we ſhould live any of our time in the fleſh, to the luſts of men: nor was it at all the end of Chriſt towards us in dying for us; <hi>But that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to ſin, might live to righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 2 24, <hi>He hath delivered us from the hand of our enemies, that we might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48912:56"/>
before him all the days of our life:</hi> that our whole time might be imployed in the Service of him who hath ſo greatly loved us, and ſo wonderfully teſtified it towards us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 74, 75. But now in Drunkenneſs is exceſs, a great waſting and miſpending our precious time, the comfortable injoyment and continuance whereof we have at ſo dear a rate: A great deal thereof is ſpent, or miſpent rather, in the act of intemperance; And a great deal in the conſequent thereof; for thereby men fit and diſpoſe themſelves to ſlothfulneſs and ſleepineſs, as is ſaid; and unfit themſelves for the ſeeking after, and ſerving the Lord, in whoſe hand is our breath, and all our time: Oh how prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal are men, ſuch men, of their time, as if it were given them to ſuch an evil end! or as if they knew not how otherwiſe to paſs it away, when as alas, our days upon the earth are as a ſhadow, and there is no abiding: And we are ſojourners here, and ſhould therefore <hi>paſs the time of our ſojourning in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 17, 18. How like fools do men act herein, eſpecially ſuch as profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to know God, and his grace in Chriſt! they cannot recall that which is paſt, nor can aſſure themſelves of a days continuance for the future: they cannot boaſt themſelves of the morrow; <hi>for they know not what a day may bring forth,</hi> Prov. 27. 1. <hi>No man is ſure
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48912:57"/>
of life,</hi> Job 24. 22. And yet how prodigal are intemperate ones of their time, as if they were delivered, or preſerved to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is right in their own eyes, or could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue themſelves in this world during their own pleaſure! Oh! it doth behove us always <hi>to redeem the time</hi> and opportunity, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>when the days are evil;</hi> that we may <hi>hear wiſdom, and watch daily at her gates, and wait at the poſts of her doors: And the holy ghoſt ſaith; To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> Heb. 3. 7, 8, 15. But alas, how ſhall we be thus found doing, if we overcharge our hearts with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs! Conſider, what exceſs and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of time there is in ſuch evil and riotous practiſes, and conſider it before it be too late; before the day and time paſs as the chaff be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you; leſt you mourn at the laſt, when the things belonging to your peace are hid from your eyes, becauſe you knew not the time of your viſitation, and ſay, <hi>How have we hated inſtruction, and our hearts deſpiſed reproof</hi>! ſay not as the people in former times did, <hi>The time is not come,</hi> the time that we ſhould come to Chriſt, and be made an habitation for God, that he may dwell in us at his houſe: for is not that time come? and yet is it time for you to make Proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48912:57"/>
Doth God continue you ſtill in the land or the living, that you ſhould abuſe your ſelves, and his good creatures, for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of your vile and brutiſh affections? <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2-4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Truly men herein are more brutiſh than many brute creatures, which are made to be taken and deſtroyed. <hi>Even the Stork in the heaven knoweth her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow obſerve the time of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (and will not be hindred therefrom by any means). But alas, intemperate ones know not the opportunity, they obſerve not the time for applying their hearts to wiſdom, that is alotted them: they ſtill in their actions cry, <hi>The time is not come for that:</hi> And therefore great will be the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſuch as go on in not knowing, or miſpending their time: For as <hi>the fiſhes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the ſnare; ſo are the ſons of men ſnared in an evil time, when it falleth ſuddenly upon them,</hi> Jerem. 8. 7, 8. Eccleſ. 8. 6-8. and 9. 12. Truly all our life-time is little enough to be ſpent in the ſervice of him who hath ſo greatly loved us, when we were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, as to give his Son to die for us: And how have good men complained of the ſhortneſs of it? <hi>Job</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 4, 5. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>My dayes are ſwifter than a Weavers ſhuttle,</hi> Job 7. 6.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48912:58"/>
               <hi>My dayes are ſwifter than a Poſt, they flee away,</hi> Job 9. 25: And yet his dayes were dayes of wonderful affliction and heavineſs; and it might be thought he might otherwiſe have judged of them: But alas, Drunkards in their exceſſive ſpending and miſpending of their times, do by their works declare, that they think their dayes are ſo long and tireſome, that they know not how to paſs them away, were it not for ſuch riotous filthy practices. Oh! that the time paſt of our life may ſuffice us, that we have waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and unprofitably miſpent ſo much of our time allotted us to ſeek the Lord in; and that now we may avoid, and flee from all Intemperance, in which is ſuch exceſs, and profuſe waſting of it: For yet <hi>while it is called to day, it is an accepted time; now is the day of ſalvation,</hi> in which we may receive his grace to purpoſe, that we may be ſaved, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2; leſt we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him at laſt to riſe up, and ſhut to the door againſt us; and then it will be too late for us to cry and call, and <hi>ſeek to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> Luk. 13. 24-26.

And this underſtanding of it, agreeth well with the ſcope of the Apoſtle in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which he had been warning the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of uncleanneſs: <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and all uncleanneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let it not be once named amongſt you, as becometh Saints; neither filthineſs, nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For this ye know, that no whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, nor unclean perſon—hath any inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Kingdom of Chriſt and of God: Let no man deceive you with vain words, for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of diſobedience: Be

not ye therefore partakers with them,</hi> Eph. 5. 3-7. And again, <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them: For it is a ſhame even to ſpeak of thoſe things which are done of them in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> verſ. 11, 12. And now to the end they might flee from, and avoid all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fleſh, he gives them this counſel, and backs it with this motive and argument, <hi>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is exceſs,</hi> or Riot; even all incontinent luſt whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: And ſo the Scripture elſewhere, and frequently ſignifies to us, that in Intemperance is uncleanneſs, that doth provoke and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men for all filthineſs and uncleanneſs whatſoever: As to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the cauſe of unnatural uncleanneſs, of going after ſtrange fleſh, and committing thoſe vile affections, in the ſervice and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, <hi>Women change the natural uſe into that which is againſt nature: Likewiſe alſo the men, leaving the natural uſe of the woman, burn in their luſt one toward another; men with men working that which is unſeemly, and even a ſhame to ſpeak of,</hi> Rom. 1. 26, 27. Eph. 5. 11, 12. And which Iniquity is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable in the ſight of God, as that by the Law thoſe that were guilty of it, <hi>ſhall ſurely be put to death, their blood ſhall be upon them,</hi> Levit. 18. 22, and 20. 13. And by the Law of Chriſt, thoſe that are guilty of it,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48912:59"/>
and not waſhed from it, <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. I ſay Intemperance leads many perſons to this abomination which is againſt nature, both Men and Women. This was the Iniquity of <hi>Sodom</hi> (which was ſo highly guilty of this unnatural abomination, as that upon the account thereof God deſtroyed them with Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven: and from whence this uncleanneſs is called <hi>Sodomy;</hi> and thoſe guilty of it, <hi>Sodomites,</hi> Gen. 19. 5-7. 24. 1 King. 14. 24, &amp;c.) I ſay, this was their Iniquity, <hi>Pride [fulneſs of bread, and abundance of idleneſs]:</hi> they ſurfeited upon the abundance of thoſe things which that fruitful Countrey afforded; and ſo apted themſelves for this Iniquity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49; with <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 28, 29. And ſo the Apoſtle ſaith of thoſe that turned the Grace of our God into laſciviouſneſs, and whom he compares to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> for going after ſtrange fleſh, and ſo defiling the fleſh; That they fed themſelves without fear, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. 7, 8-12. And Laſciviouſneſs, Luſts, Exceſs of <hi>Wine,</hi> Revellings, Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c. are all joyned together by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3, 4. And before he ſpeaks of <hi>Iſraels</hi> great Iniquity, <hi>viz. They have deeply corrupted themſelves, as in the dayes of Gibeah:</hi> at which time the inhabitants thereof were deſiring, and would have defiled themſelves
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48912:60"/>
with ſtrange fleſh, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 15, 16-22, 23. I ſay, before the Prophet taxes them with this evil, he firſt reproves them for their great Intemperance, and Drunkenneſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 5-8. and 3. 1. and 4. 11. and 7. 3-5. and 9. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And alſo in Drunkenneſs is exceſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence, as to all natural uncleanneſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: <hi>When men are fed to the full, they then,</hi> too uſually, <hi>commit adultery, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble themſelves by troops in the Harlots houſes: They are as fed horſes, every one neighing after his neighbours wife,</hi> Jer. 5. 7, 8. This the Daughters of <hi>Lot</hi> knew, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made their Father Drink <hi>Wine,</hi> that thereby he might be provoked to that Inceſtuous evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 31-38. And when the Holy Ghoſt warns the Sons of Wiſdom to beware of Drunkenneſs, he ſets before them this, as a motive to engage them to receive the admonition, <hi>viz.</hi> That it will lead to uncleanneſs: Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Look not thou upon the Wine when it is red, when it giveth its colour in the Cup, when it moveth it ſelf aright—Thine eyes ſhall behold ſtrange women, and thine heart ſhall utter perverſe things,</hi> Prov. 23. 29-31-33. So the Apoſtle puts Rioting and Drunkenneſs, before Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and Wantonneſs, to ſignify, that the former Luſts lead men and women unto, and apts them for the latter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48912:60"/>
ſo Drunkenneſs and Revellings, or, exceſs of <hi>Wine</hi> and Revellings, are joyned together; In which Revellings they gave up themſelves to, and acted all uncleanneſs and filthineſs; and whereto they prepared the way, and fitted themſelves by their Drinking <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Strong Drink</hi> exceſſively, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3. And ſurely, ſo it too oft comes to paſs, that thoſe perſons who are unſober in their uſe of the good creatures of God, do hereby ſo pamper the fleſh, as that ſuch perſons <hi>give up themſelves to laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs;</hi> and many times ſuch are ſo ſwallowed up of <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> as that they are bereaved thereby of the underſtanding of a man: and how then ſhould they be in any capacity to avoid, or abſtain from any manner of filthineſs, though it be never ſo abominable to God, loathſom to ſober men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to themſelves; and that, not unto their Souls only, but to their outward man alſo? To the end therefore that we may flee Fornication, and abſtain from all filthineſs of the fleſh, whether unnatural, or natural, which is ſo highly diſpleaſing and provoking to God, be we temperate in all things, feed we our ſelves with fear, and let us not ſurfeit on theſe periſhing meats, or drinks: <hi>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God ſhall deſtroy both it and

them: Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 13. And when we are at any time in ſuch places as in which there are rich and ſumptuous feaſts, and great abundance of <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> and may partake thereof freely; Oh! then eſpecially let us put a Knife to our Throats, if we be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given to appetite. Take we heed that we be not deſirous of thoſe dainties; for they are deceitful meat: But let us keep under our Bodies and Appetites, and bring them into ſubjection: and let us not (in this ſenſe) ſuffer our mouths to cauſe our fleſh to ſin; leſt we thereby provoke God to be angry with us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 25-27. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 6.

            <p n="1">I. What is meant and intended by <hi>[the ſpirit]</hi> here ſpoken of, and with which they ſhould be filled.

And becauſe by this holy Spirit in glorifying Chriſt, God doth work all our works in us; and perfect all that doth concern us; and all is given by this Spirit, therefore <hi>[the ſpirit]</hi> is uſed as a comprehenſive word, in which all heavenly and ſpiritual things are contained. It is even the whole of, and anſwers unto the bleſſing of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 3, <hi>I will pour [my ſpirit] upon thy ſeed, and [my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing] upon thine off-ſpring.</hi> And he is ſet down as comprehenſive of all ſpiritual good things: Hence whereas in one Evangeliſt Chriſt ſaith; <hi>How much more ſhall your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven give [good things] unto them that ask him?</hi> It is thus expreſſed in another: <hi>How much more ſhall your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father give [the holy ſpirit] to them that ask him?</hi> Mat. 7. 11. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. And this was the one thing, as it were, Chriſt promiſed that he would pray for, and ſend unto his Diſciples, when he was taking

his leave of them; <hi>even the holy ſpirit,</hi> Joh. 14. 16, 17, 26. and 15. 26. and 16. 7-15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 49.

This is the Spirit here meant and intended by the Apoſtle, of which, now in this day, the believers receive but a firſt fruits: The harveſt thereof is ſtill to be waited for, as well as the Adoption, the Redemption of the body, which is to be given and effected in due time alſo, by this holy Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11, 23. <hi>John</hi> 6. 63.</p>
            <p>And by <hi>[the ſpirit]</hi> is alſo meant, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the former, The Goſpel of Chriſt, eſpecially as it hath been now preached to us according to the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the myſtery: And many times this bears the Name of the Spirit; becauſe it hath been given forth by the Spirit, and with the holy Spirit came
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48912:64"/>
down from Heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. And the Apoſtles in preaching it, have ſpoken it, not in the words which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghoſt teacheth, compare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual: they <hi>ſpake as the holy Ghoſt gave them utterance.</hi> Yea, in theſe laſt days the Spirit was poured forth more abundantly than in former times; eſpecially after Chriſt's aſcenſion, and receit thereof in the nature of man, To make known the myſtery to the Apoſtles, and by them to us, as in former times it was not made known to the Sons of men, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10-12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 8, 9. and 3. 3-5. And with this Goſpel of Chriſt the holy Spirit is preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the World; ſo as that it is the miniſtration of the ſpirit and life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 8. And he that miniſtreth it, miniſtreth the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 5. And he that receiveth this teſtimony of Jeſus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 2. And he that rejecteth and deſpiſeth it, deſpiſeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth the holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 8. Hence the words which Chriſt ſpake unto us are ſaid to be, and <hi>are ſpirit and life,</hi> Joh. 6. 63. And the Apoſtles were able Miniſters of the new Teſtament, <hi>not of the letter, but of the ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5, 6. And the Spirit is ſaid to be the word of God, even the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. And the Teſtimony of Jeſus is <hi>the ſpirit of prophecy,</hi> Rev. 19. 10. And
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48912:64"/>
whereas our Saviour ſignifies unto us the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a mans being born of the Spirit, that he may enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 8, the Apoſtles explicating it unto us ſhews, that the immortal and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed is the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. the word of truth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18, 19. the word which by the Goſpel hath been preached to us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23-25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 21-29. And ſo alſo <hi>[the ſpirit]</hi> with which they ſhould be filled, is the Word and Teſtimony of Chriſt: And this underſtanding of it agrees well with the ſaying of the ſame Apoſtle in another Epiſtle, in which he is ſpeaking to the ſame purpoſe as here. For whereas here he ſaith, <hi>Be ye filled with the ſpirit; ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your ſelves in Pſalms, and Hymns,</hi> &amp;c. He thus elſewhere expreſſeth it: <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell richly in you in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Teaching one another in Pſalms, and Hymns,</hi> &amp;c. Compare <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18, 19, with <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. 17. And this <hi>[the ſpirit]</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ſhould be filled, the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the holy Spirit which breathes therein, and always accompanies it; and in which he teſtifies of Chriſt, glorifies him, and takes of his things, and ſhews unto us. And ſo we have briefly ſpoken to the firſt thing, and come to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. How, or in what reſpects <hi>[the Spirit]</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:48912:65"/>
anſwers unto, though yet it infinitely exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It doth appear in the very words, that though the <hi>Spirit</hi> be oppoſed unto <hi>Wine,</hi> and ſignified to be exceedingly and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly better: yet there is ſome anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs between theſe two: But there is nothing in the <hi>Spirit</hi> anſwering to any evil in the <hi>Wine.</hi> Of the former it is ſaid, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is exceſs, but not of the latter: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exceed in drinking in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> nor will our being filled therewith, lead us to any thing that is diſpleaſing unto God, or hurtful unto men: But the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth in many particulars anſwer unto <hi>Wine,</hi> as that is good, and may lawfully and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably be made uſe of by us (though ſtill, as we have ſaid, it infinitely exceeds, and excels it): As to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Wine is the blood of the Vine,</hi> or Grapes, which are the fruit of the Vine; it proceeds from the Vine, without which we could have no <hi>Wine</hi> properly ſo called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 11, 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 29. So it may be ſaid of the <hi>Spirit</hi> as ſent forth, and communicated to us; It is the blood, or fruit of the Vine, of <hi>the true Vine, which cheareth the heart of God and man,</hi> even of Jeſus Chriſt who is <hi>the true Vine,</hi> Joh. 15. 1. We could have had no <hi>Spirit</hi> but by and from him, by his having been <hi>trodden in the wine-preſs,</hi> as it were: It is indeed the blood of the <hi>Vine,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:48912:65"/>
the procurement and product of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood and ſufferings of our Gracious and bleſſed Redeemer. It is upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Wiſdom's having killed her killing, that the <hi>Wine</hi> is mingled, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> is received into the nature of man, that it might be imparted to us; and that we have any Goſpel, or glad tidings preached to us by the meſſengers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 1-3. So much our Lord Jeſus ſignifies to his Diſciples: <hi>It is expedient for you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I go away</hi> (that he departed from them by death, that <hi>he died for our offences, and roſe from the dead for our juſtification,</hi> and went to him that ſent him): <hi>For if I go not away, the Comforter,</hi> this Holy Spirit, <hi>will not come unto you: But if I depart, I will ſend him unto you,</hi> Joh. 16. 7. <hi>The Father hath ſo loved him, that he hath given all things into his hand;</hi> and particularly, given the Holy Spirit unto him without meaſure, to ſpeak and make known Gods words: But the reaſon why he ſo loved him, was becauſe <hi>he laid down his life, that he might take it again,</hi> compare <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34, 35. with <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 17. It is becauſe Chriſt died for our ſins according to the Scriptures, and was raiſed again, and exalted, that he hath received of the Father the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, which alſo he ſhed forth upon his holy Apoſtles, that by them the Preaching might be fully known, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 31-33. It
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48912:66"/>
was upon the <hi>Lamb that had been ſlain,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> ſaw the <hi>ſeven eyes, which are the ſeven Spirits of God ſent forth into all the earth,</hi> Rev. 5. 6. And becauſe this <hi>Spirit</hi> is procured for us, and diſpenſed to us by the Blood of this <hi>Vine,</hi> therefore it may be called, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in his Blood, as that which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Blood is called Blood, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 16, 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 19. So whereas in one place it is ſaid, <hi>Come drink of the Wine that I have mingled,</hi> to wit of his <hi>Spirit:</hi> In another it is ſaid, <hi>My blood is drink indeed: He that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi> ſaith our Saviour: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 3-5. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37-39. and 6. 53. 54-56. Oh! this <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Wine</hi> in this reſpect, <hi>Wine</hi> by way of eminency; it is the product of <hi>the true Vine,</hi> who hath been tormented for our tranſgreſſions, bruiſed for our Iniquities: Hence the <hi>Spirit</hi> is called, as hath been ſaid, <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him, put upon him, and ſent forth from him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 19. And the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Gods Son, <hi>whom he in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time ſent forth, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem us that were under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6. This is <hi>Wine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Blood of <hi>the true Vine;</hi> to him are we beholding for it, and have therefore cauſe to give thanks to God for his unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gift; and to do it in the name of our Lord
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48912:66"/>
Jeſus; and ſo to thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who hath been Sacrificed for us, that this <hi>Wine</hi> might be mingled for us, and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18-20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13-15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>Wine</hi> was uſed to waſh away ſpots from Garments, and make them clean and comely; for ſo much appears to be meant by that Propheſy of <hi>Jacob</hi> concerning <hi>Judah: He waſhed his garments in Wine, and his clothes in the blood of Grapes:</hi> Whereto poſſibly reſpect may be had, in ſaying, <hi>They have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> who is <hi>the true Vine,</hi> Gen. 49. 11. Rev. 7. 14. And as <hi>Wine</hi> was uſed to cleanſe away filth, the filth of Wounds, as appears, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 34: So it is certainly true concerning this Spiritual <hi>Wine:</hi> It is proper to waſh us from all our pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defilements, and to cleanſe and heal the Spiritual Maladies of our Souls: This is therefore called frequently the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> not only to denote that he is ſo in himſelf, but in his work alſo, to ſanctify us, by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſs of, and ſprinkling and applying the Blood of <hi>the true Vine,</hi> even of Chriſt, unto us. Hence the Apoſtle declaring what filthy and poluted creatures ſome of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were, he ſaith, <hi>They were waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſanctified in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48912:67"/>
1 Cor. 6. 9-11. <hi>And the Lord doth waſh away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purge the blood of Jeruſalem—by the Spirit of judgment, and by the Spirit of burning: ſo that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jeruſalem ſhall be called holy,</hi> Iſa. 4. 3, 4. And the Baptiſt doth declare unto us, that this is the work of Jeſus Chriſt, to Baptize, and waſh men with the <hi>Holy Spirit, Mar</hi> 1. 8. And the ſanctifying men, ſeparating them from their polutions, and dedicating them unto God, is attributed to the <hi>Spirit</hi> as his proper work, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1, 2. And ſo alſo in and by the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is called <hi>Spirit,</hi> as we have ſeen, Chriſt doth give us an eſcape from the pollutions of the world: <hi>And it is the power of God to ſalvation, to every one that believeth, even to ſave them from their ſins,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. <hi>Now are ye clean,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>through the word that I have ſpoken unto you,</hi> Joh. 15. 1-3. And hereby may a young man, who is moſt apt and inclinable to pollution, cleanſe his way, his works, walkings, and garments. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9, And <hi>they that are undefiled, and ſincere in the way, who walk in the Law of the Lord—they alſo do no iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 119. 1-3. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16, 17. Oh! this is <hi>Wine</hi> indeed, to cleanſe, and rinſe us from whatſoever is polluting and defiling to us; to waſh our Garments, and make them white:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48912:67"/>
and therefore thoſe who live in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> are inſtructed to walk in it alſo, whereby they ſhall be enabled to mortify the deeds of the body; and <hi>as he who hath called them is holy, ſo alſo to be holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> Gal. 5. 25. Rom. 8. 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Wine</hi> moderately taken, is proper to quench the thirſt, and ſo to allay and remove the torment and affliction thereby cauſed unto a man, which is very great; ſo as it cauſes their tongues to fail, and cleave to the roof of their mouths, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 17. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 4. Thirſt cauſes the youngeſt and ſtrongeſt to faint, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 13. And even to die, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>Judg.</hi> 15. 8. But now <hi>Wine</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to aſſwage and quench it. Hence it is given as one Branch of the deſcription of Covetous worldly men, that have no power to enjoy what God gives them: <hi>they tread their Wine-preſſes, and ſuffer thirſt:</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they refrain from, and deny themſelves that which would quench their thirſt, <hi>Job</hi> 24. 11. And the thirſty perſon is invited to buy <hi>Wine</hi> to quench his thirſt, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2. So we may ſay of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is <hi>Wine</hi> in a moſt eminent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in this reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> to quench the thirſt of the Soul and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which no other Drink or <hi>Wine</hi> will do: all other things are ſuch as will not ſatisfy: but herewith our Souls may delight themſelves, and be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48912:68"/>
abundantly ſatisfied, even every, or any, poor thirſty Soul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2, 3. Hence our Saviour <hi>in the laſt day, the great day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, ſtood and cried, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If any man thirſt</hi> (which he might do notwithſtanding that Feaſt) <hi>let him come unto me, and drink—But this ſpake he of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which they that believe on him ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37-39. And indeed, ſuch is the excellency of this Heavenly and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Wine,</hi> that it doth not ſimply quench the thirſt of the Soul; but ſo abundantly ſatisfy it, as that in continually drinking in hereof; a man ſhall be preſerved from thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after any other <hi>Wine:</hi> and he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto Chriſt continually, unto whom God hath not given the Spirit by meaſure, ſhall never thirſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 35. This will take off his deſire and appetite from all ſtolen-waters, of <hi>Wine</hi> of violence; from luſting after ſuch things as our natural <hi>Spirit</hi> is thirſting for: As our Saviour ſaith in another Metaphor, <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of any other water ſhall thirſt again: But whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him</hi> (of this <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitoe,</hi> this bleſſed <hi>Spirit, Iſa.</hi> 44. 3.) <hi>ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thirſt</hi> (to wit, after any other kind or number of Drink): <hi>But the water that I ſhall give him ſhall be in him a well of living water, ſpringing up to everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 4. 10-13, 14. Such ſhall be inebriated, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48912:68"/>
               <hi>fully ſatisfied with the fatneſs of his houſe, and he will make them drink of the River of his pleaſures: for with him is the Fountain of life,</hi> Pſal. 36. 7-9. Oh! Such a Feaſt hath God prepared for us in Chriſt, ſuch <hi>Wines</hi> on the Lees, well refined, whereto this Holy Spirit is directing us, and which it is bringing nigh unto us in the Goſpel, that were we feeding on, and drinking in hereof, our Souls would be ſo contented and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as that all exceſs in natural <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> would be bitter to us, and we ſhould loath, and not luſt after periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deceitful things, which cannot profit, nor ſatisfy us, becauſe they are vain. In Chriſt (whom this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> glorifies, and of whoſe things he receives, and ſhews unto us) it hath pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell: and therefore there is an emptineſs in all other things: And in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of this <hi>Spirit,</hi> we ſhould be helped to ſee, and ſay, and ſet our Seals to the truth of that ſaying of the Wiſdom of God by the wiſeſt of meer men, <hi>Vanity of vanities, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of Spirit,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 2. and 2. 1—II, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe as <hi>Wine</hi> doth make one <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ones poverty, and remember their miſery no more,</hi> Prov. 31. 7, and doth comfort, chear, and make merry the heart of man,

So eminently, the <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Wine</hi> indeed, and anſwers to, though it inconceivably excels all other <hi>Wine:</hi> It is proper to heal the broken-hearted, and bind up all their griefs, and to comfort all that mourn; and doth comfort them that drink it in with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Conſolations: <hi>It gives unto them beauty for aſhes, the Oyl of joy for mourning, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> Iſa. 61. 1-3. Luk. 4. 18. Hence the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is called the Comforter; becauſe it is his work and office to comfort in all tribulations, and trials, and to make the heart merry, though heavineſs be occaſioned to the outward man by the temptations and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als man here meet with, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16. 26. and 16. 7. And he is the <hi>Comforter,</hi> in bearing witneſs of Chriſt, of his ſufferings, and the glory which therethrough he hath received, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 26. And indeed this Comforter doth glad at the heart thoſe that drink in of his Cup of Conſolation, in ſhewing unto them the great abaſement of Chriſt, who by the grace of God taſted death for every man, and is raiſed again for their juſtification; and hath offered up himſelf a ſpotleſs Sacrifice unto God through this Eternal Spirit; and ſo hath made peace for us by the Blood of his Croſs; purged away the guilt of our firſt ſin and ſinſulueſs, ſo as that it is no longer retained in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48912:69"/>
Heaven againſt us; aboliſhed our firſt death, and deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil: taken out of the way all contrary to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Law of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of life in Chriſt Jeſus, doth make them free from the Law of Sin and Death, that walk after it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1-3. As well as alſo it ſhews unto us, that our loſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and all fulneſs treaſured up in Chriſt, that we might be brought back to God: That by his own Sacrifice once offered, he hath obtained plenteous Redemption, even the forgiveneſs of ſins for ever, <hi>whereof the Holy Ghoſt is a witneſs to us;</hi> and that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10-15-18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 6-11. That in him all things are ready and prepared for us, even all things pertaining to life and Godlineſs: That in him <hi>there is a feaſt of fat things prepared for all people, of wines on the lees; of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined: In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily: and in him is all compleatneſs for us: And the Spirit and the Bride ſay come,</hi> Iſa. 25. 6. Col. 2. 9, 10. Rev. 22. 16, 17. Oh! what joy hath this found of the <hi>Spirit</hi> cauſed to thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom it hath been ſounded? <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 5-8: and how hath their hearts been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and helped to rejoyce <hi>with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> who have received,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48912:70"/>
and been made to drink into this one <hi>Spirit?</hi> And <hi>Bleſſed are the people that know this joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound—In thy name they ſhall rejoyce all the day-long,</hi> Pſal. 89. 15, 16. Indeed the natural <hi>Wine</hi> exceedingly falls ſhort of this herein: though that be proper to comfort and chear the natural Spirit of a man; yet the Soul in a Spiritual conſideration may be overwhelmed with ſorrow and ſadneſs, mean time: But this <hi>Spirit</hi> will fill the heart with ſolid and durable joy; and the heart of ſuch as drink it in, ſhall rejoyce, <hi>and their joy no man taketh from them,</hi> Joh. 16. 22. with <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 16-18. And though the believing <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> received Chriſts Goſpel in much affliction, yet alſo <hi>they received it with joy of the Holy Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 6. And though now the dayes were evil in which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writes to theſe <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſinful dayes, and dayes of affliction, both which cauſe ſorrow: yet now he gives this exhortation and inſtruction to them, <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit;</hi> and ſignifies in what follows, that this would apt, and diſpoſe them to <hi>Sing, and make melody in their hearts to the Lord,</hi> Eph. 5. 18, 19. Oh! this is <hi>Wine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that will make the heart truly, ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and everlaſtingly merry, and chearful, and comfort it with everlaſting conſolations, and good hope through Grace: well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may it be likened to <hi>Wine.</hi>

5. <hi>Wine</hi> is that which is proper to deliver the natural <hi>Spirit</hi> of a man from his fears and timerouſneſs; and to make one bold, courageous againſt ones enemies, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any cauſe, or occaſion of fear. Hence we have ſuch expreſſions uſed: <hi>Like a mighty man that ſhouts by reaſon of Wine: And he ſmote his enemies in the hinder parts, he put them to a perpetual reproach,</hi> Pſal. 78. 65, 66. <hi>They ſhall devour and ſubdue with ſling-ſtones, and they ſhall drink, and make a noiſe as through wine,</hi> Zech. 9. 15. <hi>And they of Ephraim ſhall be like a mighty man, and their hearts ſhall rejoyce as through Wine,</hi> chap. 10. 5-7. And ſo it is an uſual thing now in our dayes, that men may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from fears, to drink <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Strong Drink:</hi> And indeed <hi>the Spirit is Wine</hi> in an eminent conſideration in this reſpect, namely, it is that which doth ſtrengthen againſt, and deliver from fears, thoſe that drink it in: <hi>For God hath not given us the Spirit of fear,</hi> or cowardize; <hi>but of power, of love, and of a ſound mind: Be not thou therefore aſhamed of the teſtimony of the Lord—But be thou par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the afflictions of the Goſpel, according to the power of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7, 8. Rom. 8. 15. And whoſe hearkeneth unto Chriſt, the Wiſdom of God, receives and entertains his Goſpel, and turns at his reproofs; To ſuch an one he will pour out his <hi>Spirit,</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:48912:71"/>
and make known his words: And <hi>he ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall be quiet from the fear of evil,</hi> Prov. 1. 20, 21-23, 33. Hence, as the Lord ſaith to his people in former times, <hi>My Spirit remaineth among you, fear ye not,</hi> Hag. 2. 5. So when he ſent his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel in all the world, he firſt tells them, they ſhould be indued with power, after the Holy Spirit was come upon them, and then ſhould be his witneſſes, being thus ſtrenghened and imboldened, as well as fitted and furniſhed, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 8. Truly we may ſay, This Holy Spirit in glorifying Chriſt, and ſhewing unto us, that he is indeed the Saviour of the world; In bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that plenteouſneſs of redemption, and everlaſting righteouſneſs that is in him; and the love of God manifeſted in Chriſt, and that he is Love and Charity it ſelf; hereby caſteth out all fear, all fear that hath tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of the hearty Believer hereof, as with reſpect to God: and ſaves them from his wrath, and from the fears thereof: And ſuch <hi>receive not the Spirit of bondage to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption:</hi> the Spirit of child-like boldneſs and confidence, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach through Chriſt by this <hi>Spirit</hi> unto the Father, and ſo unto the Throne of Grace, and to cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14-18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4-6, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 5. And by this <hi>Holy
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48912:71"/>
Spirit</hi> we may be delivered from the fears of death, and though we walk in the midſt of the valley of it, yet to fear none evil; becauſe in the Light, and by the Teſtimony of the <hi>Spirit</hi> we may ſee, that Chriſt hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed it, and deſtroyed him that had the power of it, that is, the Devil: <hi>And will in due time deſtroy it utterly, even this firſt death,</hi> Heb. 2. 14, 15.

And in drinking in, and walking after this <hi>Spirit,</hi> we ſhall have boldneſs in every day of judgment, and both be delivered from the fear of our enemies, and be made cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous againſt them, and wax valiant in fight: Hence the Apoſtle faith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, and ſuch as in whom this <hi>Spirit</hi> dwelleth, and abideth; <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?

Rom. 8. 1-37. Herethrough they were ſtrengthned with ſtrength in their Souls; ſtrengthned with might by his <hi>Spirit</hi> in the inner man; and the word of God abiding in them, they were ſtrong, and helped to do valiantly; even to overcome the wicked one: and not to fear what Men or Devils could do unto them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 14. and 5. 4, 5. Thoſe that drink in of this good <hi>Spirit,</hi>

are of God, and ſhall overcome all their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, becauſe greater is he that is in them, than he that is in the world: And they ſhall be valiant and victorious, <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Zech. 4. 6. And as in former times it was ſaid, The Spirit of the Lord came upon ſuch and ſuch a man, <hi>And he went out and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt his enemies,</hi> Judg. 3. 10. and 6. 34. and II. 29-33. and 14 19: Even ſo ſtill, by this <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord, we may be delivered from all our fears of amazement, and be made bold and courageous like Lions, to reſiſt and put to ſlight all our Spiritual enemies: Hence when the Apoſtle tells the believers, <hi>That they wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood; but againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al wickedneſs in high places,</hi> or things: he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to take unto themſelves, <hi>the whole armour of God;</hi> and particularly, <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may overcome the wicked one, and all his inſtruments and temptations,</hi> Eph. 6. 10-12-17. Rev. 12. 11. And ſo this ſpiritual wine is proper and powerful to deliver us from the fear of man which brings a ſnare, and cauſes men to comply, and have fellowſhip with them in their Drunkenneſs and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and in other unfruitful works of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48912:72"/>
darkneſs, leſt they ſhould incur their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or loſe their favour and friendſhip: And to ſtrengthen us to reſiſt unto blood, ſtriving againſt ſin. And in walking in this Spirit, we ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh, either for fear of the loſs of mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or for fear of their evil will, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but ſhall be ſtrengthened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and overcome the world there-through.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Wine is good to be uſed for thoſe who are infirm, and for their ſtomack ſake, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them, and help them to digeſt: And it begets and preſerves in them an appetite to their food, that they may thereby be fitted for any work or buſineſs: As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſignifies, when he ſaith to <hi>Timothy, Drink no longer water, but uſe a little wine for thy ſtomacks ſake, and thine oft infirmities,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 23. So it is as with reſpect to this heavenly and ſpiritual Wine; in drinking in thereof, and being filled therewith, this will ſtill beget in us an earneſt deſire and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite unto wiſdom's proviſion.

            <p n="7">7. <hi>Wine</hi> being drunk in, eſpecially in any large meaſure, will enflame the natural heart with love, and luſtings towards the proper object thereof: And therefore <hi>David,</hi> that he might cover his great evil and iniquity, made <hi>Uriah</hi> to eat and drink, yea <hi>he made him drunk;</hi> As knowing this was the way to cauſe him to go down to his Wife, and lye with her: and though <hi>David</hi>'s policy herein failed him, yet, therein is ſignified, that this was a proper means to bring to paſs his evil and naughty intendment, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 11-13.

               <hi>Spirit</hi> doth enflame the heart with love to Jeſus Chriſt, and God in him: It doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, make known, and ſhed abroad the love of God in the heart of the Believer, even that love, that while we were yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly: the <hi>Spirit</hi> cauſes to appear, the kindneſs, and love of God to man ward, in ſending his Son the Saviour of the world; and of Chriſt, in laying down his life for us, and taſting death by the grace of God for every man: That this love being ſeen, known, and believed by us, we might love him who hath ſo teſtified love to us, with all our hearts: and hereby is their love made perfect, who know, and believe it, and that God is love; ſo as they love him, becauſe he firſt loved them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5-8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4, 5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 13-16, 17-19.

And in diſcovering of the excellency and comelineſs of Chriſt; of the plenteouſneſs of Redemption in him by his blood, even the forgiveneſs of our ſins: of the everlaſting righteouſneſs brought in by, and treaſured up in him: of the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg hid in him: of that eternal life given us in him, and all things pertaining to life and godlineſs: of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his good ointments wherewith he is

anointed as the great Apoſtle and High-Prieſt; yea of his compleat, perfect, and univerſal lovelineſs; hereby the Spirit ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him as an object worthy to be delighted in by the Soul; <hi>And therefore do the virgins love him:</hi> He is the <hi>He, whom their Souls love,</hi> Cant. 1. 3, 4. and 5. 8-16. And this Love is ſuch as is clean, and leads to the abhorring all that is evil, even whatſoever is forbidden by the Lord, and diſcovered by the light, the Spirit in the Teſtimony, to be diſpleaſing and offenſive to the beloved. Hence, whereas God in giving forth his Law at firſt, ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods before me.

To ſignify, that the love of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſuch as is exerciſed in abſtaining from, and denying all ungodlineſs, and in cleaving unto, and following what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is well-pleaſing in the ſight of the Lord; and this <hi>Spirit</hi> is alſo purifying the heart from all unclean and filthy love, in obeying the truth, unto the unfeigned love of the Brethren, that they might <hi>love one another
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48912:75"/>
with a pure heart, fervently,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 22. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16-18.

And alſo, this <hi>Spirit,</hi> in diſcovering the greatneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiveneſs of the Love of Chriſt, to wit, that this <hi>One died for all,</hi> conſtrains the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers thereof, to love all men, even their enemies alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44, 45. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Wine</hi> is proper to make men free to ſpeak; it cauſes them to be talkative, to open their mouths freely in diſcourſing, or ſpeaking about any matter or buſineſs: So <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold my belly is as Wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burſt like new bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: I will ſpeak that I may be refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I will open my lips and anſwer:</hi> And that which made him ſo free to ſpeak, was this Spiritual <hi>Wine</hi> we are ſpeaking of. He was full of matter, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> within him did conſtrain him, <hi>Job</hi> 32. 17-20. And thus it was with the Apoſtles, and the reſidue of the Believers, when the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> was poured down from on high upon them; <hi>They were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak,</hi> &amp;c. They did
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48912:76"/>
freely declare the wonderful works of God: And though ſome fooliſh ones, mocking, ſaid, <hi>Theſe men are full of new wine,</hi> becauſe they were ſo free in ſpeaking: yet as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; <hi>Theſe were not drunken with Wine, as they ſuppoſed: But this was that which was ſpoken by the Prophet Joel: It ſhall come to paſs in the laſt dayes, ſaith God, I will pour out of my Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1-4-11-13-17, 18. This <hi>Spirit</hi> will apt and enable us to ſpeak, not as men filled with <hi>Wine</hi> do, to wit, vain and unprofitable things: But it will help us to ſpeak unto God, and to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in Chriſts name for what we want: And to <hi>give thanks unto him alwayes for all things, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 5. 18-20. The <hi>Spirit,</hi> in opening the things of Chriſt unto us, helpeth our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; for <hi>we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought; But the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings that cannot be uttered: And he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſion—according to God,</hi> Rom. 8. 26, 27. And this <hi>Spirit</hi> will apt, and incline us to be ſpeaking unto our ſelves <hi>in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual ſongs,</hi> Eph. 5. 18, 19. To be teaching and admoniſhing one another, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. And to ſpeak unto others, even all men, or any man, we have opportunity to converſe with,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48912:76"/>
that will hear: To ſpeak unto them, and make mention of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and what he hath thereby done, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into himſelf, for every poor ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mankind; And the love of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in Chriſt to man-ward: And in all, to make mention of Gods righteouſneſs, even of his only, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 29-32. <hi>The mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment: The Law of his God, even the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, is in his heart,</hi> Pſal. 37. 30, 31. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. This Holy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> doth open Wiſdoms words to thoſe that turn at her reproofs, ſo as they may ſpeak with underſtanding to others: and is like <hi>Wine</hi> within them that receive and drink it in, to conſtrain them to ſpeak what they have ſeen and heard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19, 20. And they who are filled with it, <hi>are full of power by the Spirit of the Lord—and of might, to declare unto others their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and ſins, as they have inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, opportunity, and capacity,</hi> Micah 3. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>In ſuch like reſpects, this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> doth anſwer unto, and yet infinitely exceed all <hi>Wine</hi> whatſoever; and is therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared thereunto: But we ſhall add no more to this ſecond thing, but now we come to ſpeak unto the third; Namely,</p>

III. <hi>What it is to [be filled] with the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely that is more, and a further buſineſs than to receive this bleſſed <hi>Spirit,</hi> which theſe had done: and all Believers do, in receiving the hearing, or report of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>For if any man have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, he is none of his; viz.</hi> in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar conſideration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, which ſurely theſe Believers were, as doth plentifully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the former part of the Epiſtle: Yea, and after they Believed, they were Sealed with the <hi>Holy Spirit of promiſe,</hi> which is the earneſt of the Apoſtles inheritance. They had this holy Spirit in a firſt fruits, and as a a firſt fruits of the harveſt; and as a pledg and aſſurance, that in abiding in Chriſt, they ſhould <hi>in due time gloriouſly injoy that inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and which fadeth not away, reſerved in the heavens for them who are kept by the power of God through faith unto the ſalvation ready to be revealed in theſe laſt dayes,</hi> Eph. 1. 13, 14. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3-5. By this <hi>Spirit</hi> they were Sealed and marked out unto the day of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 23. They were built upon the foundation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone—In whom they were builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit:</hi> and ſo they were brought
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48912:77"/>
and Baptized into the unity of the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 17-22. and 4. 2, 3, 4. And yet ſtill as a further buſineſs, or as to a further degree, he exhorts them, <hi>Be ye filled:</hi> for a man may be, and ſo might they be ſomewhat filled, or in ſome meaſure filled therewith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 24: and yet the Apoſtle might exhort them to be filled therewith in a greater meaſure, or to an higher degree: to be exceedingly filled, (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. 3, 4.)</p>
            <p>But before we ſpeak more particularly hereto, we may ſay, this Phraſe of being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> or Holy Ghoſt, is uſed in a double ſenſe in the Scripture: That is to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes it means, a being filled therewith after an extraordinary manner, ſo as to be enabled thereby, or furniſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with unto extraordinary things: as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times he ſo filled <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab, &amp;c.</hi> for making the Prieſts garments, the Tabernacle, <hi>&amp;c. Exod.</hi> 28. 3, 4. and 31. 3. and 35. 31-35. So others were filled with the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to enable them to Propheſy, and foretel things to come, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 41, 67. And after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, ſome were filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and <hi>ſpake with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance: And wrought many ſigns and wonders amongſt the people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 4. and 4. 30, 31. and 6.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48912:78"/>
5, 8. But now in this ſenſe the Apoſtle here intends it not: For he doth ſuppoſe that all theſe Believers might be filled in ſome ſenſe, with the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and that ſhews he intends it not after an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: as well as alſo ſo much is ſignified by the manner of expreſſion, in that he gives us to underſtand, ſomewhat was required of them hereto, and therefore exhorts them, <hi>Be ye filled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But we are here to underſtand it as all hearty and unfeigned Believers may be filled with it, as Sons of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. And ſo indeed the being filled herewith is ſomewhat, which, though oppoſed to, yet, doth anſwer unto being <hi>[Drunken]</hi> in the former part of the verſe; as being full of, or filled with <hi>Wine,</hi> and Drunken, are uſed indifferently the one for the other, as before we have ſaid, and as may be ſeen, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 13-15. Now as <hi>Wine</hi> may be in a man, and yet a man may not be Drunken; ſo the <hi>Spirit</hi> may be in a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and yet he not filled therewith, as here exhorted to: But as a man is ſaid to be Drunken, or filled with <hi>Wine,</hi> when he is in <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Strong Drink;</hi> ſo a man may be ſaid to be filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> when he is in the <hi>Spirit:</hi> (I mean not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. and 4. 1, 2. but as all Believers may be): As the Apoſtle ſaith,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48912:78"/>
               <hi>Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, if ſo be that the ſpirit of God dwell in you,</hi> Rom. 8. 9, 10. And indeed, then a man may be ſaid to be filled with it, when the word of Chriſt, and <hi>Spirit</hi> therein, dwell richly, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and abundantly in him in the full of the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt: as is expreſſed in another place, which is like unto this, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. And ſo we may ſay a little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly;</p>
            <p>As a man when he is Drunken, is ſaid to be <hi>overcome with Wine,</hi> Iſa. 28. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 9, 10. So a man is then ſaid to be filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> when he is overcome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and led, and ordered thereby in all things; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God;</hi> not only ſo as to their ſtate, but as to their excerciſe and demeanour alſo: and not only is the <hi>Spirit</hi> in ſuch an one, but alſo he is in the <hi>Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8. 14. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. as it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He being full of the Holy Spirit—was led by the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 1. Now the work of this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is to lead us out of our ſelves, out of our own wiſdom, wills, deſigns, affections, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, into Jeſus Chriſt for all: Unto him for all wiſdom, that we may be made wiſe unto ſalvation: <hi>For in him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24. and 22. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. Unto him for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48912:79"/>
all righteouſneſs; for all forgiveneſs of our ſins, and acceptation in this beloved one; putting him on by faith a a robe of righteouſneſs, to appear before God in, <hi>in whom is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 45. 24: and who is <hi>Jehovah our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 6: unto him as our holineſs, that we may be <hi>waſhed, and ſanctified in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the ſpirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. Joh. 13. 8: Unto him as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to free us, and ſet us at liberty in our minds from all bondage and thraldom whatſoever, whether to ſin, death, Satan, an evil conſcience, Law, world, or whatever we are naturally inſlaved withal, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 31, 32, 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 29-31. The work of this Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> is to lift up, and glorify Jeſus Chriſt, that we may run unto him continually, as to that good and only foundation of faith and hope, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4-7. As to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of light and teaching, who is the light of the world, the Son of righteouſneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 2. To him as the matter of our feeding, who is <hi>the living bread: and the bread that he giveth, is his fleſh, which he hath given for the life of the world,</hi> Joh. 6. 35. 51-58. So as to have our life in him, and he to be our life, the life, of our Souls and Spirits; to be our ſelf as it were, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 3, 4. And they are in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48912:79"/>
filled with this <hi>Spirit,</hi> who are not led by themſelves as men, but led and guided by this heavenly <hi>Wine,</hi> ſo as they ſuffer the loſs of all things, and go on to count them as dung, that they may gain Chriſt, and be found in him, that Chriſt may be all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as the life of their <hi>Spirits, Philip.</hi> 3. 7-9 When they are overcome of this <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſubdued and conquered by it, to be under its regiment and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being brought out of themſelves, are tranſlated and removed into Jeſus Chriſt, who is the beginning of the creation of God; And ſo live in the <hi>Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 25, and are new Creatures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 14 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. and helped to reckon themſelves in and after Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3-11. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>And then men may be ſaid to be <hi>Filled with the Spirit,</hi> when they grow up into the knowledg of Chriſt in all things, ſo as that He in the full of the Teſtimony is formed in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. And they are filled with the knowledg of Gods will in all wiſdom and Spiritual underſtanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10. And have through the knowledg of Chriſt in the Goſpel, a right judgment concerning all things effected in them. <hi>He that is Spiritual judgeth,</hi> diſcerneth, <hi>all things; yet he himſelf is judged,</hi> diſcerned, <hi>of no man,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 13-15, 16. and <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 1, 2. For this the Apoſtle prayes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48912:80"/>
for theſe <hi>Epheſian</hi> Believers, that the God of our Lord Jeſus, the Father of Glory, <hi>would give unto them the ſpirit of wiſdom and Revelation in the knowledg of Chriſt; the eyes of their underſtandings being enlightned, that they might know what is the hope of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> &amp;c. This he prayed for them <hi>who were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of promiſe, after they believed,</hi> Eph. 1. 13-17, 18-23. and 4. 30. And when as the conſequent of the former, the Believers are eſtabliſhed in the faith, and rooted and grounded in Jeſus Chriſt, ſtanding faſtly and firmly in him: For this the Apoſtle alſo prays for theſe Believers, That God <hi>would grant them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with might by his ſpirit in the inner man; that Chriſt migh dwell in their hearts by faith, That they being rooted and grounded in love, might be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height: and to know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledg: That</hi> (ſo) <hi>they might be filled whth all the fulneſs of God,</hi> Eph. 3. 16, 17-19.

have a merry heart effected in them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in Chriſt Jeſus; rejoycing with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory; and having no confidence in the fleſh: rejoycing in Chriſt, in his Croſs, and what he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by done for us, and obtained into himſelf, and is become, and is: and in what he is now doing, both from Heaven in the name of the Father, and in the anointing of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to us: and in Heaven with the father for us: and what he will do hereafter. As a man when he is in <hi>Wine,</hi> his heart is made merry and chearful therewith; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members not his former or preſent pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, affliction, and miſery, but he ſings and rejoyces: So alſo it is here in a ſpiritual conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: This Heavenly <hi>Wine</hi> being largely drunk in by us, will cauſe our hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce as through <hi>Wine,</hi> even to rejoyce in the Lord, <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 7. So here the Apoſtle exhorts theſe Believers: <hi>Be ye filled with the ſpirit—ſinging and making melody in your hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18, 19, <hi>Giving thanks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for all things</hi> (not only at ſome times, and for ſuch things as our natural ſpirit is deſiring, and pleaſed withall, but for thoſe things which ſeem to be grievous unto us alſo) <hi>unto God, and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 20. In being filled with this <hi>Spirit,</hi> they are filled with joy and peace, <hi>with joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:48912:81"/>
Rom. 14. 17. and 15. 13. And whatever occaſions of ſorrow and ſadneſs they have as with reſpect to the temptations, trials and troubles, which they here meet with, and depravations which are ordered to them: Though <hi>their belly trembles, and lips quiver, and rottenteſs enters into their bones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet they rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of their ſalvation:</hi> and even glorify him in the fires, <hi>Habbak.</hi> 3. 16-19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 7-14, 15, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6-8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 15. 16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 15.</p>
            <p>And then they may be ſaid to be <hi>Filled with the Spirit,</hi> when they walk in Chriſt Jeſus as they have received him; and through this bleſſed Spirit crucify continually the luſts and affections of the Fleſh: <hi>Mortify their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are upon the earth:</hi> then are they led by this holy Spirit, as the Apoſtle ſignifies, when he ſaith, <hi>If ye through the ſpirit do mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live: For as many as are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the Sons of God:</hi> intimating to us, that ſuch as theſe are in, and led by the <hi>Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8. 7-9, 13, 14. <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5. 16, 17. <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit, let us not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one another,</hi> verſ. 24, 25, 26. To this the Apoſtle exhorts theſe Believers, <hi>That
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48912:81"/>
they put off as concerning the former converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful luſts;</hi> To put away lying; To be angry and not ſin, <hi>&amp;c. Eph.</hi> 4. 22-30, 31. And when alſo they ſo drink in of this <hi>Wine,</hi> as that they are filled with <hi>the fruit of the Spirit, with love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance, againſt which the Law is not. The fruit of the Spirit is in all, goodneſs, and righteouſneſs, and truth,</hi> Gal. 5. 16-22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8, 9. And have the righteouſneſs of the Law ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling in them more and more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4. And are ſeeking after, and ſetting their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon things above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God: having their converſation not on earth, but in Heaven, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. and 3. 1-5. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 7-9-20.</p>
            <p>And when they are led by this <hi>Spirit,</hi> and overcome thereby, to ſpeak unto, and to be teaching, and admoniſhing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſounding forth Gods praiſes, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the word of life in word and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; holding faſt, and holding forth the profeſſion of their faith and hope, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering, without fear of men, or their fear; without fear of amazement, ſpeaking the word of Chriſt, and walking in his way, and as he hath left us an example, with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and confidence, and chearfully, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48912:82"/>
confidently enduring whatever they may meet with, and undergo: taking joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, for Chriſt and his Goſpel ſake; ſo as walking in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and humility of Chriſt; not being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any thing they ſuffer, nor counting their lives dear to themſelves, that they may finiſh their courſe with joy; when they are ſo filled with Chriſt's Goſpel, as that it is a burning fire ſhut up in their bones, and they are even <hi>conſtrained to ſpeak what they have ſeen and heard,</hi> Pſal. 39. 1-3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 7-11. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 11-13. The being filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is to be imboldned by it (as <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7. 5.) So of the Apoſtles and Believers it is ſaid, <hi>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they ſpake the word of God with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—And with great power gave the Apoſtles witneſs of the Reſurection of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 30, 31, 32. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 8. To which we ſhall not enlarge any further, becauſe we have ſpoken ſo largely in ſhewing the anſwerableneſs of the <hi>Spirit</hi> unto <hi>Wine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: nor indeed am I in a meet capacity to ſpeak any thing hereabout, becauſe I am not filled therewith my ſelf: and therefore do but darken Counſel by words without knowledg.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We come in the laſt place, briefly, to note ſome Inſtructions from this Exhortation of the Apoſtle: <hi>[Be ye filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit].</hi> Namely.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:48912:82"/>
I. That even the Believeres themſelves, which have received the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and have been ſealed therewith unto the day of Redemption, may not be filled, or ſo filled with the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> as God would have them to be, as is before ſignified in what we have ſaid: Theſe were Believers, and had received this good <hi>Spirit</hi> in ſome meaſure; and yet they are inſtructed and exhorted to be filled therewith, and made more ſpiritual thereby. The Believing-<hi>Corinthians</hi> were Baptized into one body, and made to drink into one Spirit; and yet they were not filled with the <hi>Spirit:</hi> For the Apoſtle could not ſpeak unto them as unto ſpiritual ones, but as carnal, as unto Babes in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. with <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 1-3. The Believing-<hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> though in receiving the word of Chriſt they received his Spirit; yet alas! they ſtill needed to be taught which were the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, and were become ſuch as had need of Milk, and not of ſtrong meat. Through their dulneſs of hearing, and ſlowneſs of heart to believe the firſt and great things of Gods Law, the word, of the begining of Chriſt, the Apoſtle knew not well how to ſpeak unto them of the High-Prieſthood of Chriſt, his Sacrifice which he had offered; his Mediation in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and Advocation for Believers; his coming again, with the high acts and works
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48912:83"/>
of faith, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 5. 10-14. and 6. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Theſſalonian-</hi>Believers, though they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;</hi> yet there were wants found in their Faith: and therefore the Apoſtle did pray night and day exceedingly, that he migh ſee their face, and might perfect that which was lacking in their faith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 2-6-10. and 2. 13. and 3. 10. There may be much, or ſomewhat lacking in them that have received this good <hi>Spirit,</hi> as to their being filled therewith: there may be ſomewhat wanting in their knowledg, faith, eſtabliſhment, rejoycing, confidence, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in Chriſt, conformity unto Chriſt, converſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They may be, and ſome of them are, but little children: And others, though they be young men, yet ſtill they may receive and dirnk in more and more of this <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Teſtimony of Chriſt: yea, and the fulleſt may yet be fuller, while they are here in mortal bodies: For they receive here but ſome <hi>Firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 23. And this Inſtruction may be of uſefulneſs unto us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To warn and admoniſh us all to take heed and beware of high-mindedneſs, and that we ſhould not <hi>think of our ſelves more highly than we ought to think, but to think ſoberly, as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith,</hi> Rom. 12. 2. 3. A ſad and dangerous
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48912:83"/>
thing it is for us all to think and ſay, We are rich, and increaſed with goods, and have need of nothing: This is the high-way ſo to provoke Chriſt, as to cauſe him to ſpue us out of his mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 15-17. We have none of us yet attained, nor are we already perfect, as to attainment, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 12, 13. Alas! how ſhort are we in every thing? We have cauſe continually to cry out and complain of, and and bewail our leanneſs, emptineſs, blindneſs, inſtability in the faith, inconformity to Chriſt: Oh! be we not high-minded: think we not more highly of our ſelves than is meet, for that will hinder us from coming continually unto Chriſt, who is the fountain of life, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and all ſpiritual bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This inſtruction ſhews unto us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that the receit of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is a gradual thing; it is not wholly received at once: But the Light and Spirit of Chriſt is received, and ſhines more and more unto the perfect day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>They who have obtained like precious faith with the Apoſtles, and know, and are eſtabliſhed in the word of truth, the Goſpel of our ſalvation, may grow in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1-12. with <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 18. They who are in Chriſt, <hi>go from ſtrength to ſtrength, from one degree to another, until every one of them appear before God in Zion,</hi> Pſal. 84. 4-7.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:48912:84"/>
3. This Inſtruction may teach us, that we ſhould not conclude concerning any, that they have not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, becauſe they are not ſo filled therewith as they ſhould be: for the former may be, where the latter is wanting, as we have ſeen and ſaid before: The Goſpel of Chriſt, and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> therein, may be received by men; and the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Teſtimony may be in them, though yet they are not in it; not ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, led, enlightned, eſtabliſhed, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thereby to the mind of Chriſt, as might be deſired, and ought to be endeavoured: And Chriſt <hi>will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> or dimly-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing week, but nouriſh and cheriſh every little ſpark. Be we more like-minded after the example of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that we may not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, nor diſcourage, but ſupport the weak, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 10. 1 Theſ. 5. 14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It may exhort and provoke us all to come unto Chriſt, and drink, and drink in abandantly of the <hi>Wine</hi> which is in him, for us, <hi>That we may grow thereby, and increaſe with the increaſe of God,</hi> Joh. 7. 37-39. He that cometh unto him continually, ſhall never thirſt, but his Soul ſhall be abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and his faith ſhall grow exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his charity towards all men, and eſpecially towards the Brotherhood, ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48912:84"/>
But to this we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak afterwards.</p>
            <p n="2">II. A ſecond Inſtruction we may note from theſe words is, That the Believers cannot fill themſelves with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> they have no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency hereto of themſelves, as of themſelves: Therefore he ſaith not, fill your ſelves; but, <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit:</hi> They have not the fountain of Spirit in themſelves; The <hi>Spirit</hi> is not put upon them for themſelves; but it is given unto, and reſteth upon Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 1-3: and is put upon him, that he might diſpence thereof unto us: <hi>This was he,</hi> ſaith the Baptiſt, <hi>of whom I ſpake, He that cometh after me, is preferred before me, for he was before me: And of his fulneſs have all we</hi> (Prophets, and holy ones) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 15, 16. <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily: And in him ye are compleat,</hi> Col. 1. 19. and 2. 3, 9, 10. God hath not given the <hi>Spirit</hi> by meaſure unto him, but hath immeaſurably filled him therewith: And to that end he hath ſo done, that he might pour forth thereof to us, according to our needs and capacities, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34, 35. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>Upon this ſtone</hi> (this precious corner-ſtone, and ſure foundation, this <hi>Stone which the builders diſallowed,</hi> and which <hi>is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the head of the corner), are the ſeven eyes, even the ſeven ſpirits of God, which are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48912:85"/>
ſent forth into all the earth,</hi> Zech. 3. 8, 9. and 4. 10. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 6. Indeed in us, that is, in our fleſh, in us as of us, we have no good thing dwelling: we have all ſinned, and are come ſhort of the Glory of God. But our Lord Jeſus hath reſtored that which he loſt not; and recovered by his Blood, and is poſſeſſed of all fulneſs for us; being glorified with the Father's own ſelf, <hi>with the glory which he had with him beſore the world was,</hi> Joh. 17. 4, 5. <hi>He hath the ſeven ſpirits of God,</hi> Rev. 3. 1. And from him the Apoſtles received the Holy Spirit: And <hi>unto every one of us it is given according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 4. 7-10. And this Inſtruction might be of uſefulneſs unto us all,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To hide Pride from us, and preſerve or deliver us from boaſting of, or glorying in our ſelves: for wherein are we to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ? And what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now, if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>The bleſſing of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham is in Chriſt for us Gentiles, that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit through faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 13, 14. To him are we beholding for all, and none can fill themſelves with this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> out of their own ſtore: For we are poor empty creatures, deſtitute of all
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48912:85"/>
ſpiritual good, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 12. We cannot fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, or fill our ſelves with this bleſſed <hi>Wine,</hi> but need continually to be ſupplied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with from Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 19. Where is boaſting then? it is excluded: We nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have this good <hi>Spirit</hi> of our ſelves, nor can we purchaſe it by any price of ours that we can give to God: But it is the gift, the free gift of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of God in and through him, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 32. and 8. 20. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This may alſo warn and admoniſh us, to take heed heed that we ſin not againſt Chriſt: Oh! let us all beware of him, and not provoke him, but obey his voice, leſt he withhold, or withdraw his good <hi>Spirit</hi> from us; for his it is primarily, properly, and fully: So he ſaith to the Angel of the Church in <hi>Sardis: Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven Spirits of God—Remember how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt, and repent: If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come upon thee as a thief,</hi> &amp;c. I will take away mine Holy Spirit from thee, which I have given unto thee, and which thou haſt ſo much, and ſo often grieved, and ſadned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1-3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 11. And if he take it away from us, <hi>no man hath power over the Spirit, to retain the Spirit,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 8: nor can we fill our ſelves therewith by any wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſtrength, or works of righteouſneſs
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48912:86"/>
of ours: It is not received, nor can we fill our ſelves therewith by any works of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. Oh then let us take heed and beware that we ſin not againſt Jeſus Chriſt; But let us <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> and be ruled, and ordered by him, <hi>leſt he be angry, and we periſh from the way,</hi> Pſal. 2. 12.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We may alſo note from this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in that he ſaith, <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit;</hi> That God is ſo giving his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to them that obey him, that they might be filled therewith, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 32. He is not like unto them that ſay, <hi>Be ye warmed and filled, and yet give them not needful things,</hi> Jam. 2. 16. He ſaith not, <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit,</hi> and yet withholds it from them, or gives it not unto them, ſo as they might obey his exhortation: But, <hi>He gives liberally to all men, and upbraids not,</hi> Jam. 1. 5. He who loveth a chearful giver, is himſelf a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and liberal giver, and diſpenſer of his Holy Spirit to them that believe in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37-39. He will pour out his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto ſuch as hearken to him, and receive his Goſpel, and make known his words unto them, as he hath promiſed both to the Jews and Gentiles, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20-23. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39: his readineſs to diſpence his Spirit, is manifeſted and evidenced to us, in that he hath at ſo dear a rate prepared it for us, and cauſed it to reſt upon his Son; to that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48912:86"/>
end that it might be made communicable, and be poured forth unto us, he hath killed his killing. He hath not ſpared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, and raiſed him again, and put his Spirit upon him, and poureth forth thereof to men preventingly, that they might come unto Chriſt; and diſpenſeth it plentifully, and gives it to them richly with Chriſt, who receive him, that they might be filled therewith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. Indeed, they have not this Holy Spirit in themſelves, as of themſelves; nor can fill themſelves therewith: But this needs be no diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to us; for it is in his hand who is graciouſly affected toward us: and is a bountiful giver to us according to our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, to the end we might be filled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: nor is it good or ſafe for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he gives it not, becauſe we have it not; for he gave it unto his people in former times, his good Spirit to inſtruſt them, and withheld not Manna from their mouths: nevertheleſs they were diſobedient, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt him, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 20-26. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 10.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And laſtly; In this Exhortation we may alſo learn, that there is ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the Believers, that they may be filled with this Holy Spirit; Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit.</hi> Indeed they cannot fill themſelves with it by any wiſdom or ſtrength of theirs, as we have ſeen before;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48912:87"/>
But yet this Commandment is given unto them by the Lord Jeſus, and they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to be filled with it. So in many things in which there are paſſives, there is yet ſomewhat required of them in the light and ſtrength of Gods grace: They cannot ſave themſelves; yet it is required of men to look unto Chriſt and be ſaved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 22. They cannot reconcile themſelves to God; and yet it is ſaid, <hi>We pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18, 20. Men cannot regenerate themſelves, but of Gods own will he begets with the word of truth: and yet our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Ye muſt be born again,</hi> Jam. 1. 18. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 7. So we may ſay here, they cannot fill themſelves: but yet it is required of them, <hi>Be ye filled with the ſpirit:</hi> and ſo to this end and purpoſe, that they may be filled with it, it is needfull for them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To hear wiſdom, and watch daily at her Gates, and wait at the poſts of her doors: To hearken diligently unto Chriſt, as he is ſpeaking unto us by his Goſpel; and to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the aſſemblies of his people; for where two or three of them are gathered together in his name, he hath promiſed he will be in the midſt of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 32-35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18, 20. Drunkards love their own company, ſuch as they call <hi>Good-fellows,</hi> and by frequenting their companies, they are the more provoked
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48912:87"/>
to drink, and drink largely: and the way for us to be filled with the Spirit is, not to forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves together, but to gather together, and be together, as oft as we may; <hi>For there hath God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the bleſſing, even life for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 133. 3. And to that end it is needful for us to redeem the time from other buſineſs and employment, that we may wait upon the Lord without diſtraction, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>If two lie together, then they have heat</hi> (warmth and Spirit) <hi>But how can one be warm alone?</hi> Eccl. 4. 11. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>When the diſciples of Chriſt were all with one accord in one place, ſuddenly there came a ſound from Heaven, as of a mighty ruſhing wind—And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 13, 14. and 2. 1-3, 42-47. <hi>Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God—They ſhall be fat and green; To ſhew, that the Lord is upright,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 92. 13-15. <hi>A day in his Courts is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a thouſand elſewhere—For the Lord God is a Sun and ſhield; He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84. 4, 5-10. 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Needful alſo it is, to the end we may ſtill, and further be filled with the Spirit, that we part with, and let go the things reproved by the Goſpel, and which he is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48912:88"/>
to be ſinful and poluting to us; as here he ſaith, <hi>All things that are reproved, are made manifeſt, by the light; for whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is light; Wherefore be ſaith, Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead</hi> (both perſons and things) <hi>and Chriſt ſhall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumſpectly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13-18. As ſignifying to us, that this is the way to be enlightned by, and filled with the Spirit; To abſtain from thoſe things and perſons which are evil and hurtful to us, and manifeſted ſo to be, by the light of Gods Teſtimony: And in this verſe we are ſpeaking to, he firſt gives this Admonition, <hi>Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is exceſs;</hi> before he ſaith, <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit:</hi> to give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we cannot be filled with both: but we muſt abſtain from the former, that we may be filled with the latter: <hi>For whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and wine, and new-wine, take away the heart from the mindfulneſs of the things of the ſpirit; and from the receiving and drinking them in,</hi> Hoſ. 4. 11. And provoke God to withhold, and withdraw his good Spirit from them; ſo as ſuch are inclined unto, and polluted with this Iniquity; <hi>They are all blind, they are all ignorant, they are ſuch as cannot underſtand,</hi> Iſa. 56. 10-12. Yea indeed, needful it is to deny and mortify our members upon the Earth generally, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48912:88"/>
to abſtain from all fleſhly luſts, for they war againſt the good and proſperity of the Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. Hence the Apoſtle exhorts theſe believers, To <hi>put off concerning the former converſation, the old man, which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deceitful luſts: To put away ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—To be angry and not ſin; not to ſteal; To let no corrupt, rotten communication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of their mouth</hi>—To <hi>let all bitterneſs, anger, wrath, and clamour, and evil-ſpeaking be put away from them, with all malice:</hi> or elſe they would grieve and ſadden the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and cauſe him to depart from them: For he is an holy Spirit, and will not dwell, or abide richly in them that willingly entertain, and retain what is reproved, filthy, and unclean, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 22-31. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 23. with <hi>chap.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6. 3. As is ſaid concerning Gods people in former times, <hi>They rebelled and vexed his holy ſpirit, therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought againſt them,</hi> Iſa. 63. 10. Needful therefore it is, that we may be filled with this holy Spirit, that we daily and continually lay apart all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs; and flee from the things which God is faulting by his Spirit in his Teſtimony; And then he will largely diſpence unto us this bleſſed Spirit, that we may be filled with it; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Turn you at my reproof; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48912:89"/>
make known my words unto you.</hi> Prov. 1. 21-23. So the Lord alſo ſaith concerning his people in former times: <hi>They ſhall take away all the deteſtable things—and all the abominations thereof—And I will put a new Spitit within you—But as for them whoſe heart walketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the heart of their deteſtable things, and their abominations</hi> (he will not put a new Spirit within them, but ſaith he) <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence their way upon their own head, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> And again, <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols I will cleanſe you—And a new Spirit I will put within you. And I will put my Spirit within you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 18-21. and 36. 25-27. Oh then! to the end we may be filled with this holy and bleſſed Spirit, and drink in, and drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly of this <hi>Wine,</hi> let us forſake the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, both perſons and things; <hi>And let us have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather reprove them,</hi> Eph. 5. 11-18. Come we out from amongſt men, and be we ſeperate, and let us touch no unclean thing: And this is the way for us to be filled with the <hi>Spirit, Gen.</hi> 6. 3-6. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 1-8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Needful alſo it is, that we may be filled with the Spirit, that we be emptied of our ſelves, and of our conceits of our knowledg, fulneſs, and ſufficiency: <hi>The full Soul loatheth the Honey-comb: But unto the hungry ſoul
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48912:89"/>
every bitter thing is ſweet,</hi> Prov. 27. 7. <hi>He filleth the empty and hungry with good things; but the rich he ſends empty away,</hi> Luk. 1. 5 3. <hi>Wo unto you that are full,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>for ye ſhall hunger,</hi> Luk. 6. 24, 25. When men once begin to think, and ſay, they are rich, and increaſed with goods, and have need of nothing; when they conceit they know enough already, and need not to receive help from others, and that they are already whole and clean; Alas this will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men from being filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and make them wax wanton againſt Chriſt, and ſhut the door againſt him, <hi>Rev</hi> 3. 17-20. If they think unſoberly of themſelves, and of their knowledg, parts, attainments, cleanneſs, and uprightneſs, How ſhould they <hi>as new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born babes deſire earneſtly the ſincere milk of the word, that they may be filled therewith, and grow thereby.</hi> Wo to them that are rich and full, in, and of themſelves: But, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are empty, and who hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled,</hi> Matth. 5. 6. While men retain a lie in their right hand, and fill their bellies with the wind, how ſhall they receive, and be filled with the truth, the Spirit of truth? we muſt be emptied of the former, that the latter may dwell plentifully in us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 20. Men cannot preſs forward toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in

Chriſt, unleſs they be like-minded with the Apoſtle, namely to count and reckon that they have not yet attained, neither are already perfect; that they have not yet apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12-15. <hi>Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his own eyes? there is more hope of a fool than of him,</hi> Prov. 26. 12. with <hi>chap.</hi> 29. 22.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48912:90"/>
this coming unto him is, a believing on him, as the Scripture hath ſaid; and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word cleaving to, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him: And in his Word, and Goſpel, there is Chriſt and his Spirit: So that the way to come to Chriſt, and be filled with his <hi>Spirit,</hi> is, to receive, and let the word of Chriſt dwell richly in us, as hath before been ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 18. with <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. Avoid we then, and go from the preſence of all ſtrangers that conſent not to wholſom words, the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine according to godlineſs: Reject all falſe Doctrines, and liſten not to them, for this <hi>Spirit</hi> is not in them, but another, even the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Devil, and Errour, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1-6. But receive and keep his word in the midſt of your hearts, as the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God ſaith, <hi>Let thine heart retain my words, keep my Commandments, and live,</hi> Prov. 4. 4, 5. <hi>For his words are Spirit and Life,</hi> Joh. 6. 63.

            <p n="5">5. In an exerciſe of faith, pray we, and pour out our hearts unto the Father in the

name of Chriſt, for his Holy Spirit, and for a plentiful effuſion thereof: Howl we not firſtly for Corn and Wine for the outward man, as we are too apt to do: <hi>But if any of us lack wiſdom,</hi> this Spirit of wiſdom (as who doth not?) <hi>let him ask of God, who giveth liberally to all men—and it ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him: But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering,</hi> Jam. 1. 5, 6. <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ask, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened to you: For every one that asketh, receiveth; And he that ſeeketh, findeth; And to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened—If ye being evil, know how to give good gifts to your Children; How much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Luk. 11. 7-13. <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria, and who it is that ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, Give me to drink: Thou wouldſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water,</hi> even this good and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. with <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 37-39. <hi>Ask then,</hi> in Chriſts name, <hi>and ye ſhall receive, that your joy</hi> (in the enjoyment of this <hi>Holy Spirit) may be full,</hi> Joh. 16. 24. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 6. For this the Apoſtle made mention of theſe Believers in his prayers, <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Father of Glory, <hi>would give them the Spirit
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48912:91"/>
of wiſdom and Revelation in the knowledge,</hi> and for the acknowledgment <hi>of him: The eyes of their underſtanding being enlightned, that they may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 1. 16-19. And good encouragement have we to pray, that we may be filled with this bleſſed <hi>Spirit;</hi> becauſe our Lord Jeſus, the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who by the Grace of God taſted death for every man, and is raiſed again for their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is made a quickening <hi>Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. And hath the <hi>Spirit</hi> given immeaſurably to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34, 35. And alſo prays the Father to give the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to them that ask it in his name: while they pray on earth, he prayes in Heaven for them. And hath alſo promiſed, that abiding in him, and his words abiding in them, they may ask what they will, and it ſhall be done unto them; He will do it for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13-16, 17. and <hi>chap.</hi> 15. 7. Oh then! Reſtrain we not our prayers: but as he hath encouraged, and given us liberty, let him ſee our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and hear our voice: <hi>And let us come boldly to the throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in the time of need,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. Heb. 4. 14-16.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>And laſtly,</hi> That we may be more and more abundantly filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> walk we in and after it: mind we the things of

the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the things of Chriſt, which the <hi>Spirit</hi> takes, and ſhews unto us: And be we led by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and yield up to his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; ſo ſhall we not fulful the luſts of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16. But be helped con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to mortify them, and put them to death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. And whatever this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is working in us to will and do, let us do all things without murmuring and diſputing: It will produce nothing hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in us; <hi>For the fruit of the Spirit is in all, goodneſs, and righteouſneſs, and truth,</hi> Eph. 5. 8, 9. Oh! Quench not this <hi>Spirit,</hi> but let it inflame your hearts with love to Chriſt, and God in him; and to Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, according to his Inſtructions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and fill you with joy and peace in believing: And effect in you <hi>Long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> Gal. 5. 16-22. And ſmother not this bleſſed Spirit; but work out that Salvation he is working in you, with fear and trembling; make confeſſion, and hold forth the profeſſion of the faith unto ſalvation, without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And fear not the reproach of men, nor be afraid of their fear: Follow the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this <hi>Spirit</hi> without doubting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or unto whatſoever it leads you, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. Have in uſefulneſs what God hath given to you: <hi>For to him that hath, ſhall be given, and he ſhall have

And ſow to this bleſſed <hi>Spirit,</hi> in labours of love, according to your capacity and ability: make not your bellies your gods: <hi>For he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption,</hi> everlaſting corruption: <hi>But he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting. And let us not be weary in well doing; for in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, eſpecially to the houſhold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 6-10. <hi>If thou draw out thy ſoul to the hungry, and ſatisfy the afflicted ſoul; Then ſhall thy light riſe in obſcurity, and thy darkneſs ſhall be as the noon-day: And the Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfy thy Soul in droughts, and make fat thy bones: And thou ſhalt be like a watered garden, and like a ſpring of water whoſe waters fail not,</hi> Iſa. 58. 7-11.</p>
            <p>Conſider what is ſaid, and the Lord give us underſtanding in all things. <hi>And the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt, be with us all,</hi> Amen.</p>
